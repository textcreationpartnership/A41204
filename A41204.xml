            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I my ſelf have been ſo great a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Books of this Nature, that I have long ſince read them all; and therefore ſhall give thee ſome Account of my experience, that may be both Pleaſant and Profitable to thee. As firſt, I tell thee be thou of what Age, or Sex ſoever, it is convenient for thee to read theſe ſorts of Hiſtoryes, if thou art Young, begin now, or elſe when thou comeſt to be Old and haſt any leiſure; and if one of theſe Books chances into thy hand, thou wilt be ſo pleaſed with it, that read them thou muſt, and be in danger to be laughed at by thoſe of the Younger ſort, who having already read them, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap> paſt that Knowledge, Laugh at thy Ignorance. For I have known ſeveral grave Citizens, who having formerly minded the many matters of the World, hath not only forborn reading themſelves, but forbid their Children ſo to do, as being a vain and Idle matter, and loſs of time; yet theſe very men in their latter dayes, having met with a Part of this Hiſtory, or that of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Parismus,</hi> have fallen ſo much in love with them, that they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come conceitedly Young and Amorous, and ſo highly pleaſed that they have run through all the Books of this Nature and Quality. This is a certain Truth, therefore I ſay, begin to Read, and that preſently, and to the end, thou mayeſt Read with the more Profit and Delight. I will ſet down ſome of my Obſervations, and give thee ſome Order and Method that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proceed in. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I recommend to thee a Book called, <hi>The Seven Wiſe Maſters;</hi> which is a very pleaſant Collection of variety of that Witty Hiſtory, and for the more Pleaſure of the Young Reader, there is Pictures fitted to every particular Hiſtory. This Book is of ſo great eſteem in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that next to the <hi>Horn-Book,</hi> and Knowledge of Letters, Children are in general put to Read in this; and I know that only by this Book ſeveral have learned to Read well, ſo great is the pleaſure that Young and Old take in Reading thereof. Next to that, I recommend an other Book called, <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> which is one entire Story, both Pleaſant and Profitable; and alſo well fitted with Pictures; after thou haſt read theſe, proceed to this Famous Hiſtory of <hi>Don Bellianis of Greece;</hi> which I am ſure will highly content thee, for I have purpoſely fitted the ſecond and third Parts, with Storyes acted and done in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Next to this, Read the Hiſtoryes of <hi>Parismus</hi> and <hi>Parismenos. Mountelion Knight of the Oracle:</hi> And <hi>Ornatus</hi> and <hi>Arteſia,</hi> theſe I place together, being all three written originally in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by one Perſon, who indeed compoſed them very Ingeniouſly. After theſe proceed to <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine</hi> and <hi>Orſon,</hi> which is a Famous Hiſtory, Of the Famous King <hi>Pippin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and his twelve Peers; and of the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and their Children, who were Renowned Knights of their times. Next read the Seven Champions of Chriſtendome, which tells you who thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Champions, St. <hi>George,</hi> St. <hi>David,</hi> St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> and St. <hi>Patrick</hi> and the
<pb facs="tcp:49948:3"/>reſt of them were, and much of their lives, Renowned Actions and Deaths. Then read the Hiſtory of the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> which acquaints you with the Original &amp; nature of all the Heathen Gods, &amp; Goddeſſes, as <hi>Saturn, Jupiter, Pluto, Mars, Neptune, Ceres, Juno, Proſerpine, Venus;</hi> and the Renowed <hi>Heroes, Hercules, Hector,</hi> and the reſt; With an Account of the Building ten years Siege and Deſtruction, of the ever Famous City of <hi>Troy,</hi> and by reading of this Book, you will be enabled to underſtand any peece of Poetry wherein all ſorts of Poets ſo often name the old Gods and Goddeſſes, and their numerous off-Spring. There are not many more Books of this nature Written originally <hi>Engliſh,</hi> therefore you may for varietyes ſake read them alſo, as <hi>Fragoſa,</hi> and his three Sons; <hi>Bevis of Southampton, Tom of Lincolne,</hi> with the <hi>Red Roſe Knight, Doraſtus</hi> and <hi>Fawnia,</hi> and a few others.</p>
                  <p>There are more of theſe ſorts of Hiſtoryes, which I alſo adviſe you to read, as <hi>The Mirrour of Knight hood,</hi> in nine Parts. Many having read theſe are ſo well pleaſed, that they are deſirous of more, and importunate to have them, but I can aſſure them and you, that there are no more in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Language as I could ever ſee or hear off, although I have been curious in my ſearch and enquiry. Beſides theſe there are <hi>Palmerin D' Oliva,</hi> in three Parts. <hi>Primaleon</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> in three Parts, <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in three Parts. <hi>Palmendos</hi> in one. All theſe are one continued Hiſtory of an Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople. Palmerin D' Oliva,</hi> his Son <hi>Primaleon</hi> and Grandſon <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and others, and therefore to be read in this order I have named them. Then you may read the Famous Hiſtory of <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> which is in ſix Parts in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> a Hiſtory ſo Famous and in its time ſo well accepted off, that I have ſeen about thirty Parts thereof in <hi>French, Spaniſh, Italian, Dutch,</hi> and other Languages; we have but ſix Parts in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and you are beholding to me for one of them with the ſixth, which I above twenty years ſince tranſlated out of <hi>French</hi> meerly out of my love to that Hiſtory, but I hereby gained the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, which I learned only by that means. All theſe with <hi>The Mirrour of Knight hood, Palmenus</hi> and <hi>Amadis</hi>'s, and ſeveral others, as the four Sons of <hi>Aymon. Arthur</hi> of Great <hi>Brittain. Arthur</hi> of Little <hi>Brittain,</hi> and the Hiſtory of <hi>Mervine,</hi> are tranſlations, and are now grown ſo ſcarce that you can hardly purchaſe them, and yet they are not worth the Printing agen, being now out of uſe and eſteem by an other ſort of Hiſtoryes, which are called <hi>Romances,</hi> ſome whereof are written originally in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as namely, that Incomparable Book of its time called, <hi>The Counteſs of Pembrokes Arcadia, Gods Revenge againſt Murther. Beutevolio</hi> and <hi>Vrania.</hi> The Princeſſe <hi>Clavia, Partheniſſa,</hi> and a few others, the reſt which indeed are both many in number, and exceed all but the laſt named <hi>Partheniſſa,</hi> in worth and quality; are tranſlations out of <hi>French</hi> and other Languages, as namely, <hi>Aſtrea, Polexander, Eromena, The Baniſhed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.

If to do theſe juſt actions for defence of my ſelf and friends be treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then I muſt confeſs my ſelf to be guilty, but I hardly think that any perſon who loves Juſtice, will now believe me guilty.

                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Don Billianis</hi> traveling through the Wood, and coming to a Cave entered there into, and putting off his womans Aparrel, armed himſelf as well as he could, and hid his Clothes by cutting down ſome boughs and ſpread them thereon: And the day-light approaching, he mounted his Horſe and entered the City, where he had not ridden long before he ſaw the Prince of <hi>Phenicia,</hi> who awaiting his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and knowing him by the Armour, ſoon mounting on
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49948:20"/>his Squirs Horſe, rode along with him till they arived at the Pallace; where when they came, and <hi>Don Billianis</hi> was diſmounted he knew not to whom to deliver his Horſe: which the Prince of <hi>Phenicia</hi> ſéeing, told him that his Squire ſhould doe him that ſervice, as being bound to do him any (though unknown.) <hi>Don Billianis</hi> well enough underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he meant, kindly thanked him, and taking him by the hand, they paſſed on towards the <hi>Souldan,</hi> whom was accompanied by the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and his two Brothers, who were then arming themſelves for the intended Combat. After the uſual reverence made to the <hi>Souldan; Don Billianis</hi> told him that he had ſome buſines to impart to him, but could not do it untill Duke <hi>Alfrion</hi> were preſent: Wherefore he was preſently ſent for, and brought thither by the Guards: He being come, <hi>Don Billianis</hi> acquainted the <hi>Souldan</hi> that he was to be his Champion: The Duke hearing this, did in all obleigeing manner render him many thanks, and fréely put his Cauſe and Life into his hands. The Knight having procéeded thus far in his deſigne, deſired to ſée who was the Dukes Enemy and accuſer: That am I, ſaid the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> fiercely, (thinking to affright him) and now you have ſéen me do you ſtill continue your reſolution of fighting? Yes, replyed <hi>Don Billianis,</hi> I ſhall now do it to chuſe; for by your outward appearance I cannot imagine one ſo monſtrous as you are, can be Maſter of no vertues, and therefore I beleive your accuſation falſe. You may judge if this ſpéech of <hi>Don Billianis</hi> did not inrage the furious Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, who now called out that they might preſantly begin the Combat: whereupon the Priſoners were ſent for into the Field; the Duke was there already, the Princeſs was ſoon after brought: But <hi>Don Billianis</hi> being ſent for, and the Gaurds ſéeing him (as they ſuppoſed) lye ſick in his Bed, they at the requeſt of the Damoſel that attended, went to the <hi>Souldan</hi> and acquainted him with the low condition of the Knight; he was contented that he might be excuſed from comming into the Field: And all things being in readineſs for the Combat; and the Princes <hi>Don Brianel</hi> and <hi>Arſelio</hi>

The two Princeſs <hi>Aurora</hi> and <hi>Perſiana</hi> (who ſat on a Scaffold together) ſeeing that, and beleiving it was <hi>Don Billianis,</hi> called to him, and ſo perſwaded him that he diſcovered himſelf to them. The Cerimonies of the Field being performed, they all ſix ran one aginſt another: <hi>Don Billianis</hi> undertooke the Gyant, and two Princes the two Brothers; the laſt four were by the fury of their Encounter forced to leave their Saddles, all were wounded; but <hi>Don Brianel</hi> was in the worſt condition, having one foot ſo intangled in his Stirop that he could not riſe. Moſt furious was the Encounter of <hi>Don Billianis</hi> and the Gyant, for <hi>Don Billianis</hi> his arme was run through and faſtned to his body with a péece of the Gyants lance that ſtuck in it: and the Gyant was thrown to the ground with great fury; <hi>Don Billianis</hi> was forced to diſmount to encounter the Gyant, who made up to him; but before he diſmounted, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Don Brianel</hi>'s foot ingaged in his Stirrop, and the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant (his adverſary) ready to miſchief him, he threw down the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> while he was on Horſe-back, and then leaping off; he went to aſiſt <hi>Don Brianel,</hi> but was hindred by the Gyant his adverſary; and in ſhort time the King of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> being agen on his féet, being as much inraged as any Tyger, came alſo and aſſaulted him ſo that he was forced to defend himſelf againſt two, who both gave him many weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtraokes, which did ſo inrage him that he gave the Kings brother (who had anoyed him) ſo puiſſant a ſtroak on the Helmet that it was cut in two, and wounded him on the head ſo that he was aſtoniſhed, but withall his Sword flew in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49948:21"/>péeces, and he thereby left without a weapon. Great was the fear and ſorrow of the two Princeſſe, of Duke <hi>Alfrian,</hi> and of the Damſels of the Tower, who looked from thence to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Combat, and of the Prince of <hi>Poenicia,</hi> by the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of whoſe Sword the life of the vallianteſt Knight in the World was in great danger: in fine all his friends lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and his foes rejoyced. The King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> advanced to finiſh the Combat with one blow he intended to give him, but he was miſtaken, for <hi>Don Billianis</hi> ſéeing his intent, threw the péece of his Sword that was in his hand at the Gyant with ſuch fury that it again felled him to the ground, and then conſidering what he had to do, and ſéeing a Symiter on the ground, which the Gyants brother had let fall when he was ſo wounded on the head, he ſoon took it up, and leaving the fight, went to <hi>Don Brianel</hi>'s Horſe and cut the girts, and thereby enabled him to ſtand on his féet. The Prince <hi>Arſileo</hi> had endeavoured to aſiſt <hi>Don Billianis</hi> when he was in that extremity, but he found enough to do with the Gyant he had engaged. And now <hi>Don Billianis</hi> again engaged with the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and they wounded each other in marvelous manner; but the Gyant had the worſt, loſing his left arme with a blow <hi>Don Billianis</hi> gave him. <hi>Don Brianel</hi> being at liberty undertook the other Gyant, who having loſt his Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter (which <hi>Don Billianis</hi> had recovered) fought with a mighty Mace, they wounded one another very pitteouſly; and now the Combat was equally maintained one to one; they had now fought five hours, when the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> being out of breath, and retiring to breath, <hi>Don Billianis</hi> took the oppertunity to draw out the péece of Lance from his arm that had all the time remained there; then they engaged again, and <hi>Don Billianis</hi> begining to be faint, and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to finiſh the Combat, was reſolved to venture one blow from the Gyant, ſo he ran in upon him, and when his arm was lifted up (he ſéeing the unarmed place) ran his Sword into his very heart, ſo that he fell down dead; and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was ſo wounded with the blow the Gyant had given him, that he fell down in a trance, but he ſoon after aroſe, and ſaw

                        <hi>Every one now that will adventure, may have remedy for diſpair in love as they ſhall deſerve. Thoſe that have never been overcome in Love or Arms, the ſage <hi>Medea</hi> forbids them to make any tryal hereof.</hi>

                     <p>They having read this, after a little further conference they parted, <hi>Don Contumeliano</hi> being armed and mounted rode to the place appointed, where he was highly welcomed by the Inhabitants, becauſe he brought them news that the Duke their Lord was at liberty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> after midnight arrived in the City, he went to the Souldans Pallace, which he found guarded by <hi>10000.</hi> men, but he paſſing for a woman was permitted to go through them all, even to the Tower and Chamber where the two Damſels expected him, they expreſſed great joy for his preſence, and cauſing him to go to bed, they dreſſed his wounds, and gave him ſome victuals, he not having eaten any ſince he went from thence, at their requeſt he acquainted them with all that had happened to him ſince he left them, but when he told them of the paſſages between him and the Prince of <hi>Phaenicia,</hi> they could not ſtand for laughter, by the ſtrange effects of his beauty, they came to ſpeak of that of their Ladies the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> and deſired him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore that Picture, but he made excuſe ſtill to retain it. They then diſcourſed of the Prince <hi>Perianeo,</hi> and he being jealous
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49948:23"/>that he was not only a powerful Rival but doubting he might be beloved by the Princeſs. <hi>Florisbella,</hi> asked ſeveral Queſtions to that purpoſe, which they anſwered with much prudence, telling him that the Princeſs did not love him nor did not know his Name or Quality: he only paſſing for the Knight of the <hi>Images,</hi> and ſhe knew not that he was ſo great a Prince as to be Son to the Emperor of <hi>Perſia;</hi> until he had conquered the Kingdom of <hi>Antioch</hi> and thereby diſpoſſeſſed the Princeſs <hi>Aurora</hi> of her Kingom, and ſlain her Father who was our Princeſs's Vncle, being her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers own Brother, and that for this cauſe ſhe hated him. This News pleaſed <hi>Don Billianis</hi> very well, and now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending he was deſirous to ſléep, he deſired the Damoſels to go to Bed, they did ſo, but doubting and hoping that the Knight was in love with their Lady the Princeſs <hi>Floris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella;</hi> and believing they might hear him utter ſome ſpéech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that might clear their ſuſpition, they therefore aroſe and liſtened to what he ſhould ſay, neither did they loſe their labour, for they found him wholly taken up with diſcourſes that diſcovered his love to their Princeſs: and being his Friends they reſolved at their return to their Lady, to aſſiſt him in his love with all their power, this was the nature of their diſcourſe: ſo they fell aſléep, and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſiting his Wounds which they found in ſo good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that they aſſured him in ten days to be in Capacity to Travel; he was not a little glad of it, hoping in that time to travel to <hi>Babylon,</hi> there to be bleſſed with the ſight of his Princeſs.</p>

                     <p>If the Knights and Ladies were pleaſed with their Vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, the <hi>Souldan</hi> was as much diſpleaſed at his loſs, and his grief was increaſed when he underſtood, that Duke <hi>Alfrian</hi> was releaſed, and that his Daughter the Princeſs <hi>Perſiana</hi> was taken away: He was carried out of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den into his Bed, where he was almoſt diſtracted with grief and anger. He called for a Conzen of his who was named <hi>Caroliano;</hi> and who indéed was a very valiant Knight, him he commanded to raiſe all the Forces he could in the City, and purſue his enemies, and bring back his Daughter. <hi>Caroliano</hi> in obedience to his Commands, did all that he could upon ſo ſudden a warning, and ſoon Muſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together forty thouſand men, who being armed, he led out of the City: They kept no Order in their Marcht but made all poſſible haſte to overtake their enemies, before they ſhould get into their own City and there vs Fortified and Relieved.

They ſeveral times met with <hi>Don Billianis</hi> and his Companions: and being aſſiſted by their great numbers, much endangered and wounded them. <hi>Boraldo</hi> giving <hi>Don Billianis</hi> two wounds and two blows together, one on the ſide and another on his head: cutting the Buckles of his Helmet and leaving his head unarmed; but <hi>Boraldo</hi> was with one other from <hi>Don Billi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anis</hi> thrown wounded down to the ground: <hi>Caroliano</hi> ſéeing that, killed <hi>Don Billianis</hi> Horſe, and did him ſome more miſchief, ſo that he was at that times in great danger, but by his great force and valour, be eſcaped with the loſs of the lives of many of his enemies who oppoſed him. The Kings of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and Teſſifanty performed valiantly, but were

                        <hi>DOn Billianis</hi> was diſcontent at the departure of the Knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and ſéeing likewiſe the Knights of the <hi>Crowns</hi> likewiſe preparing to depart, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them not to be ſo diſcourteous as the other, but to ſtay and have their Wounds Cured; and withal to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves to him, to this the Knight that had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated with the Knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> did conſent, and pulling off his Helmet diſcovered himſelf to be the Emperor <hi>Don Billaneo.</hi> This amazed <hi>Don Billianis</hi> and <hi>Arſileo</hi> who knew him; and they can to perform their duties to him, and in the Gréek Tongue asked who was his Companion, he told them <hi>Sabian</hi> of <hi>Trebanto</hi> who had come out of <hi>Conſtantionople</hi> with him. The other Prince and Princeſs's although they knew not his true quality, (for <hi>Don Billianis</hi> told them he was his Vnckle and the other his near Kinſman,) yet were they joyful and gave them very great reverence, and conducting them to the Palace, the Emperor laid in a rich bed to have his Wounds cured. The Princeſs <hi>Aurora</hi> knew the Emperor as having ſéen him before, and he did ſo reſemble <hi>Don Billianis</hi> that ſetting his age aſide, they were very like one another, ſhe ſpake to the Emperor making her excuſes, that ſhe could not conveniently pay thoſe high Reſpects that were due to his Imperial Majeſty. The Emperor received her with many thanks. <hi>Sabian</hi> of <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banto,</hi> was likewiſe welcomed and treated by all who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him if he knew who was the Knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi> to this he anſwered that he did, for he was named <hi>Perianeo,</hi> Son to the Emperor of <hi>Perſia;</hi> Duke <hi>Alfcian</hi> hearing this, as knowing his intent was againſt him chiefly: and that now the <hi>Souldan</hi> would not be long ere he approached with his Forces; againſt which he knew he muſt make large Prodiſion, but he being accompanyed by ſuch Valiant Knights feared the leſs, and going to Bed to his Bride had an enjoyment of that which he had ſo long deſired.

Thus did they ſpend part of that night, and the reſt in ſléeping: And the next day, continuing the Iuſts, <hi>Sabian</hi> of <hi>Trebanto</hi> being Challenger won the Honours of the day. A full Moneth they reſted quietly by reaſon of the Winter, which hindered the <hi>Souldan</hi> in advancing to them. <hi>Don Billianis</hi> grieved for the abſence of his Princeſs, and would not be comforted by the Damoſels nor Princeſs <hi>Aurora,</hi> to whom he had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his lovs, but grieving worſe and worſe; his Father perceiving of it, demanded the cauſe, but could not learn it of him, ſo that being in the Fields, the Emperor asked of him the way to the Valey of the thrée <hi>Fountains,</hi> telling him that he was by appoyntment there to méet with the Knight of <hi>Fortune.

Iuſt as they were going the ſage <hi>Bellona</hi> arrived, who went to kiſs the Emperors hands, but he took her up, and ſhe knowing they had néed of her aſſiſtance, gave them ſomewhat to eat, which when they had done, their Armour came to their right colour, and their wounds cloſing, they were as freſh and luſty as they had béen before the Combat. And then ſhe having given them a ſatisfactory anſwer to all their requeſt, ſhe told the Emperor that he muſt permit his Son to go with her to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh an adventure of very high conſequence, he willingly conſented and offered likewiſe to accompany her, but ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed that, deſiring him to go back to the City of <hi>Bollera,</hi> where the Duke had néed of him, and that when his Son had finiſhed the adventure ſhe intended he might return, and that it would not be long firſt; the Emperor was contented with their reaſons, and his ſon having asked him bleſſing, which he gave him, he mounted on Horſeback, and went with the ſage <hi>Bellona.</hi>

                     <p>The Emperor travelling towards <hi>Bollera</hi> came thither
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49948:33"/>by break of day, and wondring to ſée ſo many men in the Fields, he judged them enemies, and therefore ruſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Tents, he ſaw one wherein a Knight lay that was talking with ſeveral others that were near him, him he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be the <hi>Sophy.</hi> and near him was the Prince <hi>Perianeo</hi> they diſcourſed about another Aſſault to the City, he heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, did not mind a Knight that was Commander of theſe Guards, who coming near him and ſéeing him a ſtranger, asked what he made there, and delivered him to four others to carry him to Priſon, but he would not permit them ſo to do, wounding them all one after an other, and the firſt Knight hardly eſcaped him calling out for help. The Emperor hearing that, and knowing he muſt be gone, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved firſt to do ſome execution, and therefore he thruſt his Lance into the Tent and Bed of the Souldan, but miſſed of his aime, running betwéen his arm and ſide, however thoſe that were about him ſuppoſed him to be ſlain, and his Son went out to ſée who had been ſo hold to attempt ſuch a déed; this being done, the Emperor with great fury paſſed on wounding and killing all thoſe that were ſo bold to oppoſe him, till he came at length into his own Camp; there was he joyfully receaved, though they were much troubled when he told them that the Knight of the <hi>Golden Image</hi> was gene upon a certain adventure, and being arrived at his quarters he want to reſt himſelf.

                     <p>It was now the Spring time of the year, when their two Armies lay in ſight of each other, and the various colours that the Souldans bore upon the points of their Spears made a glorious ſhew, which together with the bright ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Armour was very pleaſant to behold.</p>

                        <hi>Don Billianis</hi> not much minding the ſenſe of what he had read, drawing his Sword approached the Cave to enter it, but upon his firſt attempt it vaniſhed. He by that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he muſt diſarm himſelf did ſo, and onely with ſword in hand procéeded, but he ſoon fell into a moſt diſmal dark place, where he was oppoſed by a monſtrous Gyant, two Centaures, and as many Lyons, here he began a mervail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Combat, and not being able to hurt them with blows, he caught one of the Lyons by the throat and choaked him, he attempted to force the Fauchion out of the Gyants hand, which prejudiced and wounded him, but the Gyant avoyded cloſing with him a great while, till in the end <hi>Don Billianis</hi> flew at him, and ſeiſing on his Fauchion, wrong it out of his hands, and with it going to ſtrike the Centaures, they and all the reſt baniſhed in an inſtant. He being now Maſter of the Fauchion aſcended a pair of ſtairs to a Hall, the paſſage or entrance to it benig ſo narrow, that he could hardly paſs through, and there he was oppoſed by many armed Knights, who were placed there as the Emperor <hi>Brandezars</hi> Guard, he being unarmed and to venturous, was wounded both in the head and begs, and much endangered, he therefore became more wary, and only defending himſelf againſt them, await<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his opportunity, and ſeiſing on one of them, forced his

This encounter had ſo weakned him, that he was forced to ſit down on the ſtairs as he ſuppoſed, but they were ſoon converted into a large gréen yard, in the middle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was a Piller with this inſcription:</p>

                        <hi>DOn Brianel</hi> and his Companion ſoon arrived within ſight of the ſtately City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which made a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and ſtately ſhew, few Cities in the Vniverſe excéeding it in every thing, there being above <hi>100000.</hi> Families with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Walls. Theſe two Knights being deſirous to know the names of each other, <hi>Don Brianel</hi> he was called the <hi>Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous</hi> Knight, the other, ſaid his name was <hi>Palineo,</hi> but ſaid he, let me adviſe you not to be called by that name here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one of that name was preſent at the death of <hi>Don Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneo,</hi> and in the Battel with the King of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> Thus did they diſcourſe, till they arrived at the City where there was a Turnament and Iuſt held betwéen ſeveral Knights and Gyants, but their arriving turned it to earneſt, for after they had done ſome execution with their Lances they drew their Swords, and flew about them, doing great execution upon the Gyants Knights, which the Gyants ſéeing they both fell upon <hi>Don Brianel,</hi> he judging their intention ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Horſe and came within them, ſo that their blows were ineffectual, only his Sheild was cleft in ſunder, but he taking his advantage, ran his Sword through the body of one of them, ſo that the Sword appeared at his back, and fell down dead to the Earth; and at the next ſtroke cut off the other Gyants arm, who ſéeing himſelf mained fled roaring away. King <hi>Trancolcano</hi> ſéeing this was aſtoniſhed and diſpleaſed ſo highly, that he commanded all his men to ſeize on thoſe two Knights, purpoſing to be revenged on them, and which <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineo</hi> ſéeing and being deſirous to prevent the danger, called to <hi>Don Brianel</hi> to depart, he ſéeing himſelf ſo ſtricktly beſet thought it was beſt to follow his advice, and therefore reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but the King ſtill commanded his Knights to purſue them, and bring them dead or alive to his preſence, but they knowing the danger ſpurd away ſo faſt, and (<hi>Palineo</hi> being well acquainted with all the private corners of the Country) went till they came to an odd Guarden, near to which was a Shepherds Cabin, there looking about and ſéeing none purſue them, they entered and there diſmounting, they found prodianter for their Horſes, and ſtaying until it was night
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49948:41"/>they then reſolved to iſſue out from thence, and viſit the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for proviſions, and to hear what news was at the Pallace.</p>

                        <hi>Palineo</hi> finding a Shepherds Cloak in the Cabin, and he having diſarmed himſelf and put on the Cloak, went out of the Cabin to the City, and paſſing for a Shepherd entered with the King, who had been in purſuit of the two Knights that had ſlain his Cozins, he entering the Pallace went to the Mines mouth, he found the door faſtn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now they being both ſo well ſupplyed, they arrived at the Pallace, where although they were ſéen and queſtioned, yet they paſſed by telling the Guards that they had béen in ſarch of the two Knights that had killed the Gyants, and now being in the Pallace, they went to the door of the Mine, which <hi>Palineo</hi> ſoon broke open, and being entered they faſtned it on the inſide with a Chain, and paſſing through the Mine, they at length came to the other door that brought them into the Caſtle, which they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and faſtning it again, and féeling in the dark for the Priſon door, found it, but faſt looked, then they conſulted what they were beſt to do, firſt they agréed upon a watch word, that they might know each other, and then going to the Caſtle Gate, <hi>Palineo</hi> ſéeing it faſt locked, and believing it neceſſary to ſecure that, he took ſome Earth and threw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lock at the Key hole, that they who were within might not at pleaſure iſſue out thereat, then all their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty was to get open the Priſon door, and deliver <hi>Damartino</hi> who was therein Priſoner, and that they attempted to do but were heard by one of the ſervants, who cryed out that ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were in the Caſtle and had ſurpriſed it. The Gyant and Knights hearing this aroſe and armed themſelves, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49948:42"/>at once ſix Knights and the Gyant came upon them; <hi>Don Brianel</hi> deſiring <hi>Palianeo</hi> to undertake the Knights, and kéep them in play while he aſſaulted the Gyant, <hi>Palineo</hi> did ſo, and the Prince ſéeing the Gyant raiſe a mighty mace to give him a puiſſant ſtroke therewith, ran within him, ſo that the Gyant miſſed of his blow. The Gyant being diſappointed of his intentions that way, caught the Knight and intended to ſtifle him betwéen his arms, but our Prince being ſenſible of the danger he was in drew a Dagger, and gave the Gyant two or thrée terrible wounds therewith, which he féeling let go the Knight and drew a Curtelax and ſtroke at <hi>Don Brianel</hi> ſo that he ſorely wounded him, but <hi>Don Brianel</hi> ſoon gave him his payment, for at the next blow he cut off one of his legs, and thereupon he fell to the Earth as if a Tower had fallen and ſoon after died. This done <hi>Don Brianel</hi> went to his Companion, who had behaved himſelf ſo valiantly, that he had ſlain four of the Knights that aſſaulted him, and now all the Knights of the Caſtle joyned againſt them, but to little purpoſe, for at the two firſt blows that <hi>Don Brianel</hi> made he gave two of them their deaths, which the reſt ſeeing, they fled towards the Gate to go out and call for help, but they nor the porter could not open it, <hi>Palineo</hi> having prevented them in that intention, which they ſéeing deſperately flew upon him and the Prince, but they ſoon received their deaths at their hands, and they being dead, they ſearched about for more enemies but could find none; and now ſéeing the Keys at the Porters girdle, they took them from thence and opened the Priſon door, where they found <hi>Damartino</hi> the late Governour, but ſo pale, weak and féeble that he was hardly to be known; He ſuppoſed they had béen Knights that were come from the Tyrant King to diſpatch him of his life, but when he was informed the contrary, and that he was frée, he was very glad, rendring thanks unto <hi>Palineo</hi> whom he knew, but <hi>Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> told him that all thanks for that was onely due to <hi>Don Brianel,</hi> without whoſe aſſiſtance there had béen nothing done nor attempted, <hi>Don Brianel</hi> was unwilling to receave this praiſes, but rendred them to <hi>Palineo.</hi> But now the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

                        <hi>Damartino</hi> being at liberty, he told them that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to deliver ſeveral others that were there Priſoners and were his ſervants, to this they agréed, and ſéeking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout found and delivered them; this done the Prince and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineo</hi> were laid in two Beds to have their wounds dreſſed by one belonging to <hi>Damartino,</hi> who was skilful in that Art, and there they continuel ſeveral days till they were well, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that if any came from the King to admit them, and <hi>Don Brianel</hi> being very curious of his Horſe and careful to have him, he was hardly to be equalled, ſent one of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to fetch them both, which they did in the dark of the evening, and now all things being in good ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them, <hi>Don Brianel</hi> being now at leiſure and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with <hi>Damartino</hi> and <hi>Palineo,</hi> told <hi>Damartino</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had done thus much for his deliverance, yet he had other buſineſs to diſpatch, having a Letter from their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Aurora</hi> directed to <hi>Damartino,</hi> which he gave him, and he opening it found theſe Lines:</p>

                     <p>This done, <hi>Don Brianel</hi> and his Couzins advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Damartino</hi> and <hi>Palineo,</hi> and preſenting them to them ſaid, that they had cauſe to render thanks to the Gods for their good Fortune, in ordering it ſo as that they met, theſe Knights who were his Kinsmen, and were come about the ſame Employment that they were engaged in, and to that end, had brought from the <hi>Souldan</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> a very ſtrong Army, which however ſhould be diſpoſed and ordered as they ſhould direct. <hi>Palineo</hi> made a very courteous Reply: being as he ſaid, very well ſatisfied in the misfortune of his Encounter, thinking it no diſhonour to be diſmounted and vanquiſhed too, by Knights of his alliance. And <hi>Damarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> concluded that as to the ordering of their affairs, it would be neceſſary for them to go back to the Caſtle, and there adviſe further thereof, only ſending to the Army to ſtay where they were till further order.</p>

                     <p>TWo hours before day did <hi>Lucidamore</hi> and <hi>Damartino</hi> bring their Forces to the City Walls, intending to ſurprize it, &amp; they made up towards that Gate which was intended to be opened for them: neither were <hi>Don Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineo,</hi> and <hi>Don Brianel</hi> &amp; <hi>Palineo,</hi> unmindful of what they had promiſed, but paſſing through the Mine, and hearing the approach of the Army, they went to the Gate, their paſſage was indifferent cleer, becauſe the King and his Forces were gone another way, but when they came to the Gate to put their determinate purpoſe in execution, they there found a ſufficient Guard to defend it; however being reſolved to proſecute their intentions, the politick <hi>Palineo,</hi> went to the Porter that had the Keys, and giving him a great blow over the Head, that cleft it in twain; he took the Keys from him, but how ever he could not perform his intention in opening the Gate, for he was ſet upon by ſeveral Knights at once, he defended himſelf very well, and offended his Enemies by the aſſiſtance of his two Princely Companions, but the King <hi>Tramolcano,</hi> hearing of this attempt, and being reſolved to prevent it, went in company of Count <hi>Garino</hi> and a great Troop to aſſiſt his Guard; they ſpurred on with great fury thinking to overcome the Princes, which <hi>Clarineo</hi> ſeacute;eing,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49948:45"/>ran the Gyants borſe thorow, who being mortally wounded overthrew his Maſter, <hi>Garino</hi> intending the ſame, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented for <hi>Palineo</hi> ſtepping aſide, with one blow beat him from his Horſe, but they did both ariſe agen, and they &amp; their Forces did ſo furiouſly aſſault our thrée Knights, that they were in great danger of their lives, had they not béen reſcued as you ſhall preſently hear. It was near morning when a little without the City might be ſéen a Pillar of fire, which approached the Walls: after it two Gyants that carried a Ladder, and ſet it againſt the Wall, and a Knight whoſe Armor was garniſhed with Baſilisks, who diſmounting from his Horſe, mounted the Ladder up to the City Wall. <hi>Don Lucidamore</hi> who was without and ſaw this, did likewiſe mount the Ladder and follow him; they were oppoſed by ſome that were on the top of the Walls, but the Knight of the Baſilisks either killed them or threw them down headlong, and ſéeing certain ſteps in the Wall he thereby diſcended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill followed by <hi>Lucidamore;</hi> when they came down they made great ſlaughter, till they arrived where the thrée diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed Knights were: <hi>Don Brianel</hi> not knowing him to be their Friend, made a blow at him, but he knowing him, warded it, and procéeded againſt his Enemies, at one blow killing the trayterous Count <hi>Garino;</hi> and then he cryed out, <hi>Courage brave Knights, for you are relieved:</hi> And immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately at another ſtroak he cut off the Gyants legg, ſo that he fell down dead; and now the Forces without ſéeing they could not enter at the Gate, made a breach in the Wall, and entred there, and ſoon after <hi>Palineo</hi> being recovered, opened the Gate. But ſo great was the Multitude of King <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleano</hi>'s Forces that it was almoſt impoſſible to overcome them, and they knowing that they muſt all dye if they were overcome, fought like mad men or in diſpair; <hi>Damartino</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering hereof, &amp; grieving that ſo many men ſhould periſh, conſidered of a way to prevent it, and therefore he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all his men to cry aloud: <hi>Antioch for the Princeſs Aurora,</hi> thoſe of the City hearing this, although they were before engaged for their King <hi>Tramoleano,</hi> as they thought in their

The Aſſembly being broken up, and all things thus orderly ſetled; he thought of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and having acquainted his Brothers and Couzen, where he had left his Father, and that it was neceſſary for them all to go to him, they agréed to ſend the Army before by Sea, to the City of <hi>Perſepolis</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> there to attend his or the orders of the Emperor his Father: They being thus diſpatched away, (he and his Brothers) &amp; <hi>Don Brianel</hi> ſtayed eighth dayes longer in the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to ſée all things put into quiet and order. And every thing being as they wiſhed for, they deſired to depart: but the Governour, <hi>Damartino</hi> and Count <hi>Garino,</hi> had ſo importuned them to know who they really were, that they in the end told them, however, oblieging them to kéep their knowledge thereof private. They reſted amazed and contented, that their Kingdome was ſetled in ſuch quiet, by the aſiſtance of ſuch great Princes: And ordering Guides to wait on them, and direct them out of that Countrey, the neareſt way to <hi>Perſia,</hi> they departed; and in this Iourney we ſhall leave them, and withal, here Conclude this Firſt Part, of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>HISTORY.</hi>

                        </hi> and <hi>Floriſpiano</hi> performed wonders: the valiant King <hi>Armenia</hi> was all this while ingaged in Combate with <hi>Caroliano,</hi> where he gave and received many wounds, and their Fight continued ſo long, that both their horſes were ſlain, and the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> was in a great jeopardy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for many of the Knights of <hi>Caroliano's</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron (ſéeing their Commander likely to be overcome by the King of <hi>Armenia</hi>) did violently aſſault him, and brought him to great extremity, having wounded him in many places, &amp; he had very nigh fainted with his great loſs of blood, when the King of <hi>Teſifante</hi> accompanied with <hi>500</hi> Kts. came to his reſcue, &amp; again mounted him on the horſe of one of the knights that he had ſlain.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Battel continued indifferent on both ſides, till <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldo</hi> and <hi>Don Fermoſel</hi> arrived with their ſeveral Squadrons of fifty tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49948:49"/>reſiſt the furious aſſaults that would be made.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Emperor (who as I told you before was ingaged in a bloody Fight with the <hi>Knight of the Images</hi>) was forced to leave the Combate unfiniſhed, to retire to the City to reſcue it, which he heard was well nigh taken: being come near the gates of the City, he ſaw that the enemy had gotten poſſeſſion of part of the wall, and likewiſe he ſaw <hi>the Knight of the Images</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind him with all his Forces, wherefore he ſéeing the extreamity of the buſineſs haſted into the City, and ſtood in the réer of all his Forces, and was the laſt man that entred, holding a continual Fight with his enemies, till he ſaw all his own Forces were within the walls, and then he himſelf entred, not permitting any of his enemies Forces to enter with him, which they by all means attempted to do: ſo ſoon as he was entred, and the gate ſtrongly faſtned, he repaired to that part of the wall which he ſaw was poſſeſſed by the enemy, and mounting thereon, being followed by ſeveral valiant Knights, ſoon tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the enemies from the wall, and kept the poſſeſsion thereof; but all this, and what ever elſe they could do, did not hinder the enemy from getting the poſſeſsion of the wall in many places, which they at laſt kept in deſpight of all the Forces of the City, and were ready to deſcend the wall and enter the City, when they heard a great noiſe of Trumpets and Clarions, and a great company of armed Knights behind them, who gave a great aſſault to thoſe of their Forces that were below; at which they were greatly aſtoniſhed, and ſéeing them come forward with a great deal of impetuoſity and deſtruction of many of their Forces, the chief Commander who had getten the poſſeſsion of the wall, came down to help their companions, and the reſt, who ſtill remained on the wall, were ſoon forced from thence, and thrown headlong down, where they ended their lives.</p>
                     <p>Thus was the Battel again revived, and many of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans Knights and Gyants loſt their lives, by the invincible arms of four or five Knights, who came in company of the late Forces that came to relieve the City: but among the reſt, there was one Knight who was armed with an armor garniſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49948:50"/>and killed four Giants, and yet he was not at all wearied, but ſtill beſtowed ſuch deadly ſtrokes amongſt the Souldans knights, that they all fled from him as from their immediate death, till at laſt the two brothers, <hi>Caroliano</hi> and <hi>Boraldo,</hi> both aſſaulted him, and laid many weighty ſtrokes both on his ſhield and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, but he reached one of them ſo great a blow, that he made him catch hold on his horſes neck, to ſave himſelf from falling, and then being much enraged gave the other ſuch a thruſt that he tumbled him from his horſe, and ſo he procéeded killing and deſtroying all that durſt withſtand him. In the mean time his other four companions were not idle, for they behaved themſelves with extraordinary courage. It was two hours before day, when this battel firſt began, and now it was about four of the clock in the afternoon, and yet it was not ended: but at laſt the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans Knights and Giants being much wearied, were about to retreat when they once more ſaw freſh Forces coming towards them, which was indéed commanded by the Souldan himſelf, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When they in the City ſaw this, they informed the Emperor <hi>Don Bellaneo</hi> thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who commanded one of the Gates to be immediately opened, out of which he iſſued with ten thouſand men, and went immmediately to the place where the <hi>Knight of the Baſilisks</hi> was engaged, and ſéeing him do ſuch wonders, and ſuppoſing him to command the reſt, he ſaid to him: Knight, ſince you have, though unknown, endeavored to give us ſo great aid, I yray let it be uſed to the beſt advantage, which will be at this time with all convenient ſpéed, to retire into the City, elſe you will preſently be overpowred by their great Forces, and then your aſſsiſtance will be of little effect. The <hi>Knight of the Baſilisks</hi> gave attention to this advice, and knowing not only the perſon that gave it, but that it was alſo very good, endeavored by his own example and actions, to retire to the City, and ſo he and his companions did with all their Forces, only with the loſs of tvvo thouſand men vvhich vvere killed in the Battel and

                     <p>Thus every one having made choice with whom to fight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to overcome or die in the place, and they only expected the coming of the Challengers out of the City. About ten of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49948:56"/>clock before noon, the Souldan with a guard of forty thouſand Knights iſſued out of one of the Gares with the Champions, ready for the Combat. The Souldan being ſeated in a place appointed for that purpoſe, and the Guard placed without one ſide of the Liſts, the Challengers with the found of Drums and Trumpets entred the ſame, where they had not long continued, but the Defendants likewiſe entred, and the Guard on their ſide being placed on another ſide of the Liſts: the Souldan comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Signal of the fight to be given by the Trumpets, at whoſe ſound the Knights with armed fury made againſt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſuch ſort, that they rather ſéemed to many ſudden flaſhes of lighting, breaking through the airy paſſage of the Heaven, than men and horſe met in the midſt of the field with ſo mighty encounters, as if ſo many pieces of Ordnance had béen diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> thinking himſelf concerned more then ordinary, encountred the <hi>Knight of the Images</hi> ſo violently, that he cauſed him to lay hold on his horſe neck to ſave himſelf from falling, and with the ſhock that he received, he loſt both his ſtirrops: but they both ſoon recovered themſelves, and turning about, with a brave grace and courage drew their ſwords, and gave one another ſuch ſtrong and mighty blows, that their pure cutting ſwords ſoon made the blood to appear through their Armor</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49948:57"/>blow received from his enemy, was greatly abaſhed, ſo that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf with his ſhield, he gave the Emperor many wounds: which he féeling, and reſolving to be revenged of, gave his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſo great a blow on the ſhield, that he cut it in two pieces, and wounded him ſo ſorely on the head and arm, that he in ſhort time fell to the ground: which the Emperor ſéeing he left him, and went to Duke <hi>Alfiron</hi> who wanted his aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alfiron</hi> and <hi>Contumeliano</hi> encountring the two Brothers, gave to each other ſo marvellous encounters, that they all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured their lengths on the earth: but like valiant Knights they ſoon got on their féet and began an excellent Combat, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a long time without any great advantage; but in the end <hi>Garoliano,</hi> with whom <hi>Alfiron</hi> fought, gave him ſo great a blow on the head, that he cut the laces of his helmet, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wounded his head; but <hi>Alfiron</hi> reſolving to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, gave <hi>Caroliano</hi> ſo mighty a blow on the helmet, that it much aſtoniſhed him, and paſſing from thence wounded his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der very ſorely: but the blow having found ſo great reſiſtance, his ſword brake in two pieces; whereupon <hi>Caroliano</hi> though ſorely wounded, ſéeing his Adverſary without helmet or ſword, went forward with a reſolution that one blow ſhould put an end to the Combat: but juſt as he went to perform what he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Emperor met him and reſcued <hi>Alfiron,</hi> who ſéeing the deſperateneſs of his condition, being without a ſword, eſpied that of <hi>Gramalis</hi> lying by him, ſuddenly took it up, and went to receive his enemy, who was now fighting with the Emperor. <hi>Contumeliano</hi> and his enemy were not idle, but did their utmoſt devoirs like good Knights, to endanger each other, ſo that the ground where they ſtood was dyed with the blood that came from the great number of wounds they received.</p>
                     <p>This battel had continued eight hours, and neither of the two Knights, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> nor <hi>Perianeo,</hi> ſhewed any kind of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs; and though they were much wounded, yet continued they as vigorus and ſtrong as at the beginning. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> being much enraged hereat, did his utmoſt endeavor to put his enemy out of breath, which he did perform by his quickneſs and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſtrokes which he gave him, ſo that in the end his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my could not hurt him, and bid nothing but defend himſelf. But

                        <hi>Perianeo</hi> being enraged that he was ſo likely to be overcome, reſolved to put all his ſtrength to one blow, which he did in ſuch ſort, that ſtriking <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> on the helmet, he put him out of all remembrance, and his horſe being ſomwhat wounded, ran about the field with him. So ſoon as he came to himſelf, and found in what condition he was, and that his enemy purſued him to take away his life, he caught hold on his ſword which hung to this wriſt with a chain, and being enraged far more than any Bul or Lion, he lifted up his ſword and gave his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſo great a blow on the thigh, that he cut him to the hard bone, from which wound iſſued much blood; and redoubled his ſtroke in ſuch manner on his Adverſaries helm, that he beat him quite from his horſe without any ſenſe or underſtanding: and looking about him, ſaw the Duke <hi>Alfiron</hi> likewiſe on the ground with one blow he had received from <hi>Caroliano</hi> on the head, where he had nothing to defend it: but the Emperor ſoon revenged this wrong, for he gave <hi>Caroliano</hi> ſo mighty a blow on the head, that he laid him on the earth. <hi>Contumeliano</hi> and his Adverſary <hi>Boraldo</hi> were both grown very faint, and <hi>Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meliano</hi> was at laſt forced to retire. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> perceiving how the day was likely to be their own, diſmounted from his horſe with a reſolution to kill <hi>Don Perianeo,</hi> if he were not dead already: but on an inſtant there hapned a great flaſh of lightning and thunder, and there iſſued from a Cloud a Charriot of Fire drawn by ſix Griffions, and in the Charriot there was an old man, who with the help of a Dwarf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49948:59"/>for theſe Wars had held them a long time from proſecuting their other adventures.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſt renowned Knights, I ſee no cauſe why we ſhould not all conclude with Peace, ſince the Souldan hath ſent us ſuch fair Propoſitions, wherefore my opinion is, that the Princeſs <hi>Perſiana</hi> be forthwith ſent for, that the Souldan may receive the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction he deſires, which I am confident ſhe will give him: And ſince the Souldan is ſo reaſonable, I am fully ſatisfied; for my only buſineſs was to reſtore the Princeſs <hi>Aurora</hi> to her Kingdom of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which was uſurped by <hi>Don Gallaneo,</hi> who ſince he is dead, we have gotten poſſeſſion of it. I am confident we ſhall perſwade the Souldan to confirm her in the poſſeſſion of the ſame, and that he will give us all the ſatisfaction we ſhall deſire.</hi>

                     <p>After this Spéech was ended, there was not one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany but reſted contented, and thereupon a party of five thouſand Horſe was immediately diſpatched away under the Conduct of <hi>Don Gorion,</hi> Brother to Duke <hi>Alfiron,</hi> to conduct the Princeſs thither: and the Meſſenger of the Sonldan was ſent back with another Knight of the Duke <hi>Alfirons</hi> part, to ſignifie to the Souldan, that all that he deſired on behalf of his Maſter, and the reſt of the Kings and Princes, ſhould be performed to his own ſatisfaction, which Meſſage being delivered to the Souldan greatly contented him.</p>

                        <hi>Don Brianel</hi> was very well ſatisfied with this Meſſage, and went immediately to the two Princeſſes to certifie them thereof; which when they heard, they were both very well contented: the Princeſs <hi>Perſiana,</hi> in that her mind was wholly accompliſhed; and the Princeſs <hi>Aurora,</hi> in that ſhe now hoped ere long to be fully ſetled in her Kingdom: wherefore they both prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to depart the next morning and accordingly commanded their Damſels: to get all things ready.</p>

                        <hi>Sir Knight, <hi>I have underſtood your love to me, and therefore have formerly repoſed ſo much truſt to you, as I never did to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49948:60"/>any other; for to you alone I committed the diſpoſal of my Kingdom, and for the good you did me there, I heartily thank you. Aſſure your ſelf that ſo ſoon as I ſhall be peaceably ſetled therein, I ſhall diſpoſe my affairs in ſuch order that I ſhall do all things to your content and liking: and aſſure your ſelf, that none other living ſhall enjoy my perſon and kingdom but your ſelf.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>At the ending of the ſpéech, ſhe bluſhed extreamly that ſhe had béen ſo frée in diſcovering the thoughts of her heart: but <hi>Don Brianel</hi> was extreamly ſatisfied herewith, and not being able to ſpeak with the exceſs of joy that he was in, he fell on his knées, and ſtraitly embracing her legs, he very amorouſly kiſſed her fair hands, and then at her deſire he aroſe and gave her many amorous kiſſes and kind embraces, promiſing for ever to be her true Knight: and ſhe promiſed no leſs to him, that ſhe would not fail to be always his, and in token of her love, ſhe gave him a Scarf embroidered with Gold, where in Letters of Gold was her Name; which he thankfully received, and promiſed never to leave off wearing the ſame, till he had the frée enjoyment of her perſon in marriage. And hereupon they broke off their friendly and amorous diſcourſe, taking a farewell of each other, he returning to put all things in readineſs for the next days ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and ſhe retiring her ſelf into her Cloſet, to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate what ſhe had done.</p>
                     <p>Thus every body employed themſelves in ſomwhat for the next days journy, till it was time to go to reſt: but the two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Don Brianel</hi> and <hi>Aurora</hi> could ſléep but little that night for the content they had received in the evenings conference, and therefore they were the firſt that did riſe, by whoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all the reſt ſoon riſe and made themſelves ready. <hi>Don Gori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Don Brianel</hi> ſummoned the Knights and Magiſtrates of the City together, to whom they declared the will of their Lord <hi>Alfiron.</hi> And leaving a ſufficient guard in the City, they went to the Pallace, where they found the Princeſſes in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to depart.

                     <p>Thus travelled they with much content, till at length they met with ſome of the Knights of the Emperors Army, who were come on purpoſe to méet them: and then ſome were ſent back to ſignifie to the Emperor and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Princeſſes ſéeing that, deſcended from their Chariots and kindly received them: Then two ſtately Palfreys were brought whereon the two Princeſſes were mounted, and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> took hold of the Reins of the Princeſs <hi>Aurora's</hi> Palfrey, and the Emperor himſelf did the ſame for <hi>Perſiana.</hi>

                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> during the remainder of their Journy, asked the Princeſs <hi>Aurora</hi> whether ſhe had received any content in the company of <hi>Don Brianel?</hi> for, ſaith he I ſée by his countenance that he is very much pleaſed, and he ſhe weth very gloriouſly with the Favor that he hath tyed to his arm, and therefore I deſire to know what Miſtriſs he hath gotten ſince our departure. To which diſcourſe the Princeſs replyed: Sir Knight, the content that I have received in his company cannot chufe but be much
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49948:61"/>in reſpect of the ſervice that he hath already done me, in helping to reſtore me to my kingdom, and therefore in token of my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, I have given him that Scarf as a ſmall token of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to him.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch like communication ſpent they their time, till they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Camp, where they alighted and were received with great Ioy, ſignified by the ſound of Drums and Trumpets, and Clarions: The Princeſſes <hi>Perſiana</hi> and <hi>Aurora</hi> were conducted to a Tent for that purpoſe provided, where they both lodged to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: the Duke <hi>Alfiron</hi> being contented not to lye with his beloved Princeſs, till ſhe ſhould be given him by her Father, which he hoped would be done the next morning. Night being come every one repaired to their ſeveral lodgings and their took their ordinary repoſe, onely <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was much troubled that he was ſtill kept there, and hindred from viſiting his Princeſs <hi>Elorisbella,</hi> and beſides he knew not how to go to her for his Father expected upon the concluſion of the Peace, that he would return with him to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In theſe meditations he ſpent moſt part of the night, and when morning came he aroſe and diſpatched a meſſenger into the City, to certifie the Souldan of his Daughters arrival, and to know his pleaſure what ſhould be done. To which the Souldan returned anſwer, that he expected her and the Duke to come to his preſence that day, in company of what other Knights they pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>The Duke and Princeſs being certyfied hereof, prepared themſelves for that purpoſe, and about noon, only accompanied with the Princeſs <hi>Aurora, Don Bellianis,</hi> and <hi>Don Brianel,</hi> they entred the City, and came into the preſence of the Souldan, who was ſeated on a throne, and his great Lords about him. The Princeſs <hi>Perſiana</hi> and the Duke humbled themſelves on their knees, and ſhe humbly deſired her Father to forgive her raſhneſs, for it was onely, true love that cauſed her to do the ſame and promiſed him that if he would deign to pardon that great fault, ſhe would in all things continue his obedient Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter during life, and concluding her Spéech, ſhe ſhed many tears: To which the Souldan replyed, that her diſobedience to his commands, had occaſioned the loſs of the lives of many of his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49948:61"/>Subjects, and that therefore ſhe might expect the Gods to be continually angred with all her undertakings; but as for his part, ſéeing ſhe had made ſo frée a confeſſion of her fault, he did fréely forgive her, and then ariſing from his Throne, he came down and took her by the hand, and raiſed her from the ground, and then cauſed the Duke <hi>Alfiron</hi> to ariſe, to whom he gave her wiſhing the Gods to bleſs them.</p>
                     <p>Thus this being done to the content of all that were preſent, the Souldan commanded the Tables to be coveted, and deſired the ſtrangers to ſit down to dinner, promiſing in the afternoon to give them ſatisfaction in order to a general peace.</p>

                     <p>SO long travelled the Princeſs <hi>Aurora</hi> and the Princes and Knights that accompanied her, that at laſt they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in the Kingdome of <hi>Antioch,</hi> without happening on any conſiderable Adventure: and when, they were come néer the City, <hi>Damartino</hi> the Govenor, and Count <hi>Garino.</hi> with ſeveral others of the Nobility, being advertiſed of their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49948:63"/>coming, went out to méet them. So ſoon as they approached néer to the Princeſs, they diſmounted from their horſes, and on their knées bid her wellcome: but ſhe likewiſe diſmounted, and entred a Tent that was prepared and ſet up for that purpoſe, where ſhe permitted her hands to be kiſſed by ſeveral of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Great thanks was returned to <hi>Don Brianel</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, not only for the good they had done them in recovering the kingdom, and in that reſtoring their Liberties which were formerly loſt by the uſurpation of the late Tyrants, but alſo for their making them ſo happy in the ſight of their dear Princeſs, whom they had now brought home to them. After a ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt which was provided in the Tent was ended, they all mounted again with a reſolution to enter the City: the place where they had ſtayed was a league from the City, yet all the fields and places during their paſſage was beſet with multitudes of people, who cryed with continual noiſe, The Gods preſerve our Royal Quéen <hi>Aurora.</hi> Being thus accompanied, they entred the City, and in good order arrived at the Pallace, where by reaſon it was night, the Princeſs diſmiſſed the multitude with thanks, and ſo every one being much wearied with this days journy, went to take their ordinary repoſe. The next day they were no ſéener up, but the cry continued, and great was the accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations that were made by the multitude.</p>
                     <p>That which the Quéen took firſt into her conſideration, was the ordering of her houſhold, and the firſh Officer ſhe made was the Controller thereof, which Office ſhe gave to <hi>Don Brianel,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ere long to make him Controller of her Perſon. This joy continued many days, and many were the Iouſts and Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments that were exerciſed to delight the Quéen, in which exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the Knights that accompanied her thither, ſtill bore away the prize, however the Count <hi>Gariano</hi> demeaned himſelf like a val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and hardy Knight, maintaining the Iouſts for one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Knights-adventurers, in which time he diſmounted above twenty Knights.</p>
                     <p>The Quéen underſtanding one day that <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> and <hi>Don Lucidamore, Don Contumeliano,</hi> and <hi>Floriſpiano</hi> intended to leave her Court, and to go ſéek out adventures elſwhere, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before their departure to conſumate her marriage with <hi>Don

This news gave great ſatisfaction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> and <hi>Don Lucidamore,</hi> that their Couſin had ſo great good fortune, to be wedded to ſo vertuons a Princeſs, and therefore notwithſtanding their former reſolutions to depart they and <hi>Contumeliano</hi> and <hi>Flioriſpianio</hi> reſolved to ſtay, and aſſiſt at the Solemnization of thoſe Ceremonies, where we vvill leave them in great content, to treat of other matters.</p>

Thus lay he muſing and wondring with himſelf what place he was in ſometime believing all that he ſaw to be only fancy, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while ſuppoſing himſelf to be in his Fathers Court laid out for dead in ſome Chamber there: and this he was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to by reaſon of the blackneſs of every thing about him.</p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49948:64"/>
                     <p>At length two Damſels entred the room at a door placed in a corner thereof, they were both habited in black, the one carried a Candle in her hand, and the other followed her with a Box wherein were Dyntments and Plaiſters: coming to the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide they found him awake, and in pretty good condition. He ſéeing them continue their ſilence, began thus to them: Ladies I have received one kindneſs from you already, for which I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you thanks, and deſire you to binde me to you for another, which is, that you will tell me in what place I am, and how I came hither.</p>
                     <p>The Ladies hearing him ſpeak with ſo great moderation, gave him this Anſwer: Sir Knight, how you came hither we know not, but yeſterday you were brought in hither by the Lord of this place, whoſe name is <hi>Fristone,</hi> and delivered to our kéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, telling us that we muſt apply theſe Medicines to your wounds, ſhewing us likewiſe that you were ſuch a perſon as was very well able to requite what kindneſs we ſhould afford you: As for the name of this place we cannot tell you, for it is not long ſince we were brought hither by an adventure, of which we ſhall tell you more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Thus after they had ended their diſcourſe, they deſired him to permit them to ſearth his wounds, which he conſented to, and they, after they had applyed remedies to his wounds, departed, leaving him ſomewhat better ſatisfied than he was.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IT was yet but early in the morning when <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his Company parted, and therefore we will leave them in their Iourney towards <hi>Shyraz,</hi> to tell you what befel <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> who travelled ſo long with the Damſel that at laſt they arrived in ſight of a Caſtle ſeated on a Rock, which when the Damſel eſpied, ſhe ſaid, Sir Knight, this is the Caſtle where the Gyants and the other company lodged this night, and I believe they are not as yet come out of it, becauſe he that is Lord of this Caſtle is of kindred to the Gyant <hi>Altifer,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray let us attend here for their coming forth. <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis</hi> therefore adviſing with himſelf, left two of his Knights to attend there, whilſt he and the reſt travelled on the way the Gyants were to take, and there they hid themſelves in a thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of Trees.</p>
                     <p>It was not fully an hour before the two Knights came gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping amain to <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> informing him that the Giants and their company were come out of the Caſtle, and were coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-wards with the priſoners. The Prince <hi>Baltaſano</hi> they tyed on a horſe with his hands behind him, and ſo they did to about twelve Knights more that were priſoners, and the Princeſs <hi>Martaroſa</hi> and ſeveral of her Damſels, were carried before cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Knights on horſeback, and did make great lamentation.</p>
                     <p>The Knights did likewiſe adviſe <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> not to ſet on the Gyants and their eompany as yet, for that the Gyant of the Caſtle where they lay was come out with them, with above twenty Knights to bear them company a little way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49948:70"/>it was beſt to forbear ſetting on them till they were gone: To this adviſe <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> could hardly be perſwaded, ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt was his deſire to do ſome ſignal Service for his Lady the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella;</hi> but in the end he was over-ruled by the Damſel, and promiſed to attend their parting for an hour or two, and if they did not by that time leave one another, that he would ſet upon them all. And in this reſolution he marched forwards, commanding the two Knights to go back &amp; give him notice of what ſhould happen, which was done accordingly. Thus did <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> march on for one hour in great expectation, till at length the two Knights came to him to inform him that now was the time, for the Gyants kinſman was departed, and there was not above thirty five Knights and three Gyants, and ten of the Knights were employed in guarding of the priſoners that were with them.</p>
                     <p>Never was <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſo well pleaſed in all his life as he was at this inſtant, and therefore commanding all his Knights to be in a readineſs, the urned back his horſe, and went to meet the Gyants and their company. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> had not rid far before he met with them, the two Gyants brothers to <hi>Altifer,</hi> riding before the reſt on great horſes, and with Iron Maces hanging on their Sadle-bows. Our Knights went ſtrait up to them, and ſome of the Princeſſes Damſels making a lamentation, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> enquired what was the cauſe why they forced Ladies to go with them againſt their wills? to which one of the Gyants proudly anſwered, It were beſt for you, Sir Knight, to keep on your way, and not to meddle with the affairs of others, not being called thereto. To which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. that he and all other Knights were bound to enquire into the affairs of diſtreſſed Ladies, and to relieve them to their power, whereupon one of the Gyants laid hold on his Mace, thinking to daſh him in peices, but he turning his horſe on one ſide, couched his Lance and run ſo fiercely on the other Gyant, that he forced him to meaſure his length on the earth, at whoſe example all the reſt of the company did the like, and they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their parts ſo well, that ſixtéen Knights and two Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were diſmounted, and ſix were ſlain out right.</p>
                     <p>The Giant <hi>Altifer</hi> ſéeing himſelf ſo beſet, preſently couched his lance and did ſome miſchief: But <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſoon hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

                     <p>The Giant <hi>Altifer,</hi> and his two brothers ſéeing the vallor of that one Knight, reſolved to ſet upon him, and ſo they all thrée came with the ſame reſolution, but he quickly ſéeing the danger he was likely to run into, if he did not diſpatch, gave one of them ſo powerful a blow, that he cut off his Arm, and forced him to let his Mace fall to the Ground.</p>
                     <p>The two brothers ſéeing this, came with both their Maces at once, intending to beat him to peices; but <hi>Baltaſano</hi> who he had unbound having gotten a Sword, Buckler and Helmet, received one of them, and gave him in return ſo puiſſant a ſtroke, that he cut off one of his arms and wounded him in the ſhoulder; the enraged Giants did all they could to revenge the Wounds they had received, and <hi>Altifer</hi> himſelf ſéeing that he was like to looſe his Miſtriſs, left the Combat, and coming to the Knight that had the Princeſs in guard before him, and took her and ſet her on his own horſe before him, and did ride away with all the ſpéed poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: at which action the Damſels gave a great ſcréech, which <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> hearing much wondred, and leaving the fight, turned himſelf about, but he had no ſooner perceived the cauſe, but like lightning he made haſt after him, and being very well mounted, he ſoon overtook him, which the Giant ſéeing, he let fall the Lady, and turned about to encounter <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> being glad that he had gotten him alone; and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was no leſs glad then he, not only for that, but alſo in regard that he had let go the Princeſs, fearing much that if he had held her ſtill ſhe might have béen hurt in the combat. Thus theſe two Combatants equally reſolved, affaulted each other, and gave and received many Wounds, but <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> whoſe valor was not to be equalled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49948:71"/>Ladies kinſ-woman to ſhew the utmoſt effects thereof, gave the Giant two ſuch mighty blows, that with the one he cut off his Leg, and with the other he quite killed him.</p>
                     <p>The Princeſs all this while beholding the Combat and ſéeing the mighty blows <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> gave the Giant, could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine who it ſhould be, and that ſo much worth and ſtrength ſhould remain in one ſingle Knight, but well viewing his arms, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred him to be <hi>the Knight of the Baſiſisks,</hi> who had done ſuch brave acts at <hi>Babylon</hi> for the relief of her Couſin the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> and viewing her Picture on his Shield, ſhe immediately cried out, Ah worthy Knight? pattern of all true Valor and Magnanimity, much am I bound to you for your great aid and aſſiſtance, and many thanks have I cauſe to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you for this ſo mighty deliverance in this my moſt extream neceſſity: Having thus ſaid, ſhe came near him to kiſs his hands, but he refuſed that and kindly embracing her, ſaid: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, it is time for us to return back to ſée in what condition the Prince your Brother is, and if occaſion be to lend him my aſſiſtance: wherefore he cauſed her to mount on the Giants horſe, and he mounting on his own, ſet forwards towards the place of the Combat; in which time ſhe again thanked him for the aid he had afforded her, promiſing him to do him all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Love or friendſhip that ſhe could, if he would pleaſe to come to the Souldan of <hi>Babylons</hi> Palace as he had formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; telling him that ſhe was now reſolved to return back thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and aſſuring him that the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> her Couſin had an extraordinary eſtéem for him, and expected his coming: and ſhe aſſured him that ſhe would endeavor to increaſe her good affection towards him.</p>
                     <p>Much joyed was <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> at this diſcourſe, and thus they arrived at the place of Combat, where the two Giants and all their Knights were either ſlain or vanquiſhed: Thus was this fight happily ended to the eternal honor of <hi>Don Bellianis.</hi>

                     <p>After they had paſſed the <hi>Tapyrian</hi> Mountains, they came to a great River called <hi>Bradamir,</hi> which watereth the City, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards falleth into the <hi>Perſian Gulph</hi> with twenty miles circling about on the land: when they came near the City, it was the pleaſanteſt thing in the World to behold, ſo ſtately a Building, twenty ſtately Temples appeared at one time, and the Pallace with its lofty Towers made an extraordinary ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorin the eyes of the ſpectators.

                     <p>Theſe excellent perſons were received into this moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome place, with a great deal of ſolemnity and joy, and in all the principal places of that City, and all other places of the nation, they were immediately Proclaimed King and Queen of <hi>Shyraz, Larr,</hi> and <hi>Jaarown,</hi> Lord and Lady of <hi>Ormus, Maqueroon, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moen, Chuſeſtam, Sigeſtan,</hi> and <hi>Farſeſtan,</hi> Prince and Princeſs of the <hi>Gulph</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and of the Iſles there. Theſe were the titles, and great was the joy and acclamations of all that vaſt kingdom, which reaches above ſix hundred miles round about. If I ſhould recite to you the many ſhews, pageants, and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant arches that were built, and the ſeveral congratulatory Speeches that were that day made to their new King and Queen, I ſhould as much weary you with the reading, and my ſelf with the writing thereof, as they were that day wearied with the hearing of them, and indeed they were ſo tedious, that although they came to the City by two of the clock afternoon, yet was it nine of the clock at night before they came to the pallace: whither they being arrived, they diſmiſſed moſt of their ſubjects, and being much wearied they went to take their ordinary repoſe, which through wearineſs every one enjoyed, except <hi>Don Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anis</hi> whoſe deſires were wholly fixed on the incomparable <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risbella,</hi> from whoſe preſence he had been ſo long abſent, that he was in great doubt of his reception into her ſervice, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that day made him by the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what conſolate his diſturbed fancy.

This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation being ſent abroad occaſioned many Knights to reſort to the Court, ſo that by the time prefixed for the Triumph, as well the fields adjoyning to the City, as the City it ſelf was ſilled with Knights, ſo that it was a moſt delectable ſight to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and moſt delicious to hear the ſound of ſo many Warlike Inſtruments as was at that time heard. And the King cauſed certain Rayls to be made on the out-ſide of the City, within which the Knights were to Tilt and perform their Deeds of Knighthood, and cauſes a Throne to be placed there for himſelf and his Queen, and Seats for the reſt of the Nobility, where they might ſit and ſee the Tournaments: and he further or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained twenty Knights of his own, who were commanded by one <hi>Don Lorino</hi> Son to his Brother <hi>Don Gorino,</hi> a young and hardy Knight, to reſiſt all ſtrange Knights.</p>

How the Day of the Coronation being come, there entred into the Court a Knight, who termed himſelf to be <hi>The Knight of the Iſland of Pearls,</hi> and demanded the Kingdom of <hi>Shyraz</hi> as his right, and offered to defend his Title in ſingle Combate againſt any one Knight; which Combate <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, and vanquiſhed him, and of his departure for <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe Kingdom of <hi>Shyraz,</hi> whereof the Duke <hi>Alfiron</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Perſiana</hi> were now in poſſeſſion, had for many years belonged to the Souldan of <hi>Perſia,</hi> Father to the Princeſs, who had given the ſame to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as hath already been declared: but wee have not yet told you how the Souldan of <hi>Perſia</hi> came by the ſame.</p>
                     <p>So it was, that the Father of this Souldan onely had tribute for the ſame of one <hi>Gozmin,</hi> a valiant Knight, but the ſaid <hi>Gozmin</hi> for ſome trayterous enterprize was diſpoſſeſſed of the ſame? He being executed, and his ſons for ever diſenabled to poſſeſs the ſame, for a juſt reward of their fathers treaſon, and then the Souldan took the ſame into his own poſſeſſion, and ever after that took the immediate Profits thereof to his own uſe, onely appointing a Governor there, whom he placed and diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as often as he thought fit, and in this condition he left it to his Son when he died, who (as I told you) gave it fréely to his Son in Law Duke <hi>Alfiron,</hi> as a Portion with his Daughter. Now this <hi>Gozmin</hi> left two Sons behind him, both valiant and ſtout Knights, the eldeſt whereof lived in an Iſland in the <hi>Perſian Gulph.</hi> called <hi>The Iſland of Pearls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The day being come wherein this great Ceremony of Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the King and Queen was to be performed, every one aroſe early either to aſſiſt at, or behold the Ceremony: The King and Quéen being ready, mounted in a Triumphant Chariot, and by four Vnicorns were drawn to the great Temple, where they being arrived mounted on a Scaffold prepared to that purpoſe and then the Chief <hi>Flamin</hi> of the City, after the ordinary Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, placed two Crowns of Gold, enriched with many
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49948:74"/>pretious Stones of ineſtimable value on their heads, praying to the Gods to bleſs them with perpetual bleſſings, and bleſſing all their friends, and true and loyal Subjects, and curſing all ſuch as were or ſhould be their enemies. This Ceremony being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, they both deſcended from their Thrones, and walking through the Temple remounted their Chariot, riding therein through the City with their Crowns on to the Court, where they were no ſooner arrived, but the Tables were ſpread with all manner of delicious Viands that the Country could afford, many Healths going round the Table for the proſperity of the King and Queen. After Dinner was ended, before any perſon did ariſe from Table, the Herald at Arms (according to cuſtome, did after the ſound of an innumerable company of Trumpets) again proclaim the ſaid Duke and Princeſs to be King and Queen of <hi>Shyraz, Larr,</hi> and <hi>Jaarown,</hi> Lord and Lady of <hi>Ormus, Maque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roon, Kermoen, Chuſeſtan, Sigeſtan,</hi> and <hi>Farſeſtan,</hi> Prince and Princeſs of the <hi>Culph</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and of the Iſles there.</p>
                     <p>Theſe words he pronounced twice, and at the end of every ſuch Proclamation he ſaid, if any one had any right to the ſame, or any part thereof, he bid them come forth and declare the ſame. This had been done twice, and the <hi>Herald</hi> was about to begin the third time, when a Knight armed in an azure Armor, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to hold his peace; which he obeyed, and then the Knight going up to the place where the King and Queen ſat, ſpake as followeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Duke Alfiron, <hi>for by no other name ſhall I own you: It is not unknown to moſt of the people here preſent, that my Title to this Crown of</hi> Shyraz, <hi>and all the Territories thereto belonging, is juſt and good, when they ſhall know that I am Son to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> Gozmin, <hi>ſometimes King of this place, I had long ſince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the Souldan would have reſtored me to my undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted right, but ſince I ſee that he hath been ſo unjuſt as to give it away, I am to tell thee, that if thou wilt enjoy it, I muſt firſt be dead; and therefore I will thee preſently to appoint at thy Champion to defend thy Title, and to enter into the Liſts with me immediately, not queſtioning but the Gods will ſo far do me juſtice, that I ſhall be enabled to deſtroy thy Champion.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus ſaid, he held his peace: This Spéech gave a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49948:74"/>wonderful aſtoniſhment to all the perſons there preſent, and gave the King and Queen a ſenſible trouble to be thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in the midſt of their Solemnity. The King anſwered That he was ſo well ſatisfied in the Iuſtice of the Quarrel, that he was ready himſelf to enter the Field to vindicate his Right, but the Queen diſwaded him therefrom, not queſtioning but that they ſhould find ſome other Champion.</p>
                     <p>Many Knights preſently aroſe, and deſired the King and Queen that they might have the Honor of the Combate, but the King was reſolved not to venture his Title in the hands of any, but ſuch a one as he ſhould be very confident of his worth, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> thinking himſelf obliged to do ſomewhat, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to undertake the Combate, and therefore ariſing from his ſeat, deſired the King and Queen to admit him to be their Champion, and to put the tryal of their Cauſe into his hands. The King would willingly have excuſed it, by reaſon of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Obligations which he had already received from him: but <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> who vvas reſolved not to be denyed, preſſed them ſo hard, that at length they condeſcended. Whereupon he deſired that the Combate might preſently be performed. To which the other Knight willingly conſented, and the place intended for the Iouſts, was the place appointed for the Combate; to which place every one preſently repaired, much wondring at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Knight of <hi>the Iſland of Pearls,</hi> for ſo he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and was known to be the beſt Knight in all that Countrey.</p>

                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> having Armed himſelf, preſently repaired to the place appointed for the Combate, where when he came, he found the Knight of <hi>the Iſland of Pearls,</hi> and the King and Queen, and moſt of the Nobility ſeated near the Liſts, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this Combate. Both the Combatants were armed with very good Armor, <hi>Don Bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The other Knight was as well armed and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when taking each of them a Launce, at the ſound of the Trumpets they couched their Launces, and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> with the great deſire he had to hit his enemy, miſſed his encounter: but the other knight did not ſo, but hit his enemy ſo fircely on the Shield, that <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> loſt both his Stirrops; whereat
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49948:73"/>he was ſo extreamly enraged, that throwing away his Launce without making any uſe thereof, he drew his Sword, which his enemy likewiſe did, and gave <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> a mighty blow on the Helm.</p>

During the time of this Combate with the Knights, their Horſes began a fiterce Combate, for they ran violently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one another, and lifting vp their fore féet wounded each other, and what they could not do, they performed with their téeth, biting one another in marvelous manner, to the great aſtoniſhment of the beholders. Thus continnued they a good while, but in the end <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> his Horſe cauſed the other to run away, which was taken notice of to be a good Omen to his Maſter, who in the mean time was not idle: But reſolving ſo ſoon as this Combate was finiſhed to be gone, therefore he did his utmoſt endeavor to vanquiſh his enemy, whom he had ſo wounded in ſeverall places, that it was impoſſible for him to continnue much longer. But <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> being much vexed at the tediouſneſs of the fight, lifting up his Sword very high, gave the Knight ſo great a ſtroke on the Helm. that it cut it in pieces, and wounded his head in ſuch manner that he fell to the earth, when preſently ſetting the point of his Sword to his Breaſt, he asked him if he would acknowledge the King and Quéen to be his lawful Sovereigns? To which the Knight replyed, He would never conſent to any ſuch thing during his life. Whereupon <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> without any more a do, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately cut off his Head, and then he went to the Herauld, and commanded him to go forward with his Proclamation, which he accordingly did in open field, with the general acclamations of many thouſands of people who were there preſent.</p>

                     <p>At which words the <hi>Knight of the Golden Image</hi> much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, not knowing how he ſhould be diſcovered in ſo ſtrange a Countrey: But the Lady ſoon ſatisfied him of that doubt, by telling him that ſhe belonged to the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> and was one of thoſe that was with her Miſtreſs releaſed from the power of the Gyant <hi>Altifer</hi> and his Companions, by the ſtrength and power of his invincible arm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> much vvondring to ſée her, courteouſly asked her in vvhat health her Lady vvas, and the cauſe of her travel, To this, Sir Knight, replyed ſhe, I ſhall give you an anſwer, on condition that you forthvvith go along vvith me to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and there preſent your ſelf to my Miſtriſs and the Princeſs <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risbella,</hi> and there receive ſuch Orders from them as they ſhall give, to vvhich Requeſt he readily conſented; vvherefore they ſetting forvvards on theſe Iourney, the Lady began her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as follovveth.</p>
                     <p>Know then moſt valiant and redoubted Knight, that never ſince the Walls of <hi>Babylon</hi> was built by the brave <hi>Semiramis,</hi> was greater ſorrow within that City then there is now, and never was there greater cauſe of mourning; for it is not a wéek ſince one of the greateſt pieces of Treachery was committed that ever was heard of.</p>
                     <p>One day the Souldan, our Dread Lord, accompanied by his Empereſs <hi>Silviana,</hi> the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> the Princeſs <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taroſa</hi> my Miſtriſs, and many other great Perſonages, having been a Hunting, were met by a grave Old Man and two Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, they were all thrée drawn in a Charriot, and coming near our company, they all made the moſt pitiful complaint in the world: The Souldan taking compaſſion on them, demanded what was the cauſe of their ſo great complaint: To which ſpéech the old man replyed, that he being travelling to <hi>Babylon</hi> with thoſe two Damſels and his Daughter, two Knights ſéeing his Daughter of admirable beauty, deſired her company to abuſe her, which ſhe not conſenting to, they endeavored to force her, and in the end notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance they could make, they drew her out of the Chariot, intending to execute their luſts upon her: but ſhe reſolving rather to dye than looſe her honor, ſo long reſiſted them, that one of them moſt inhumanly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49948:76"/>drew his Sword, and gave her ſo great a wound on the head, that ſhe immediately fell as dead to the ground, which they ſéeing, immediatly mounted there horſes and departed leaving my poor daughter ſtretehed along the graſs ſtrugling for life: In this manner we all remained making excéeding lamentations, when an old Matron coming by, and being told the accaſion of our complaint, commanded us to bind up the wound, and lay her in the Chariot, telling us that ſhe was not to be cured, but by one ſingle touch of the faireſt hand in the world, now ſir, we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Babylon,</hi> to ſée if we can finde the perſon that ſhall cure this Lady.</p>
                     <p>The Souldan and his Daughter having heard this diſcourſe, and ſéeing the Lady lie ſtretched along in the Charriot, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were deſirous to ſée where the wound was given, for which cauſe they both entred the Charriot, at which time the old man whipped his horſes to make them go on, but they ſtirred not one jot; at which he much wondred, and the Princeſs coming to the body of the extended Lady, and touching her wound, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenly lifted up her head, and opening her eyes heartily thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Princeſs for her cure, for by her touching the wound ſhe was immediately cured. Much did the old man wonder, that not withſtanding all he could do to the horſes that drew the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot he could not get them to move one foot, but they ſtood as if their feet had been fixed to the ground: and as much was the Princeſs, and the reſt of the company pleaſed with the finiſhing of the adventure and therefore the Princeſs ſeeing there was nothing elſe to be done, deſcended from the Chariot, which ſhe had no ſooner done, but the horſes that drew it immediately fell a running in a very violent maner not giving the Emperor leave to come out; which the Ladies and Knights ſeeing, were greatly abaſhed thereat, and the Empreſs commanded many of the Knights who were beſt mounted, to follow the Charriot and bring back the Souldan, but all their haſt availed them nothing for the horſes that drew the Charriot, ran with incredible ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, till they vvho purſued them quite loſt ſigh thereof. Great vvas the lamentations and ſorrovv of the Empreſs, the Princeſs her Daughter, and all the reſt of the ſpectators, not knovving vvhat was become of the Souldan, but they ſtill hoped that ſome
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49948:77"/>of the Knights would overtake the Chariot, but though all the company ſtayed there ſix hours, and all the Knight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Great was the ſorrow of the Empreſs and her Daughter, and all the reſt of the company, but it growing late they were forced to go back to the City in much dolor; by the way as they went a Damſel came, and meeting the Empreſs gave her a Letter. and immediately departed, which ſhe greatly wondering at, cauſed the ſame to be immediately broken open, wherein was read as followeth.</p>

                     <p>But the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> knowing that her Brother the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> intended to accompany him in this Adventure, perſwaded him that ſince the Iourney was long, and that he was to travel on the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea to ſome uncertain place there, that he would not refuſe his company, which he at laſt aſſenced to.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49948:84"/>Lodgings, he attended not long before one of the Princeſſes Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels came to his Chamber, to advertiſe him that the two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes were together and expected him; He thereupon very joyfully went to the Chamber where they were and proſtrating himſelf on his knée, he humbly kiſſed her hand, but ſhe not permitting it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to ariſe, and ſeating her ſelf by him, ſaid unto him:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Worthy Sir, Since it hath pleaſed the Heavens to put ſo great a croſs upon us, as ſo ſoon to part us, I beſeech you by the friendſhip and love that you have ſo zealouſly profeſſed to me, that you will not only make all the expedition you can in returning back from this Adventure, but alſo do the beſt you can to ſecure your perſon, not thruſting your ſelf into any unneceſſary hazard; for know Sir, that ſince you are become my Knight, I reſolve to keep ſuch a ſtrict power over you, that I ſhall not be won to conſent that you ſhall do any thing to endanger your perſon, and were it not on ſo neceſſary an occaſion I ſhould not give you leave to depart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having ſaid thus, ſhe hung down her head and fetched a déep ſigh expreſſing by that the ſorrow ſhe took for his departure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thus replyed to her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gratious Madam, Since it hath pleaſed you to give your ſelf ſo much trouble to have ſome care of my unworthy perſon, I ſhall endeavour in this, as well as in all other things, to obey your commands, aſſuring you that this Adventure being finiſhed, I ſhall immediately return back, and ſhall not hereafter undertake any Adventure without your leave firſt obtained, not queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning but I ſhall be able to perform whatſoever I ſhall begin, through the mighty aſſiſtance I have received by being under your protection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus did theſe two Lovers diſcourſe with one another, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times embracing each other: and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> knowing that he was to be gone the next day, took more fréedom than ordinary, and Kaviſhed from her lips many amorous kiſſes, which to him were more pleaſant than <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> or the food of the Gods. Thus ſpent they much time, and would have continued their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous diſcourſes longer, but that the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> cauſed them to break off and depart, which they at laſt very unwillingly conſented to: Thus at length they retired to their ſeveral Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and went to Bed, taking their ordinary repoſe.</p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:49948:85"/>
                     <p>The morning being come, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> aroſe early to put all things in order for his departure, but he had not béen long up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> and two of his Kinſmen came to wait on him in his Lodging, but not finding him there they walked into the Garden where they found him, and there the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> told him that he was ready to go with him whenſoever he ſhould appoint him, but told him that he humbly begged him to permit thoſe two Knights to go in their company. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> who was unwilling to deny him any thing he ſhould ask, at length at the intreaty of the two knights themſelves conſented; and thereupon he bid them be ready, for that Afternoon he intended to ſet forward on his Iourney, they reſting very well ſatiſfied, and prepared all things acordingly.</p>
                     <p>Thus Noon being come and Dinner ended he took his farewel of the Empreſs, the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Matta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſa,</hi> and all the reſt of the Court. The Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> gave him a new Shield, wherein was her own Picture drawn to the Life, and Rickly guilded, whereby he went by the Name of the <hi>Knight of the Golden Image.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> was armed in an Azure Armor, and in his Shield he had a <hi>Boars-head;</hi> he having formerly killed a monſtrous Boar, and therefore he was called the <hi>Knight of the Boar.</hi> The other two Knights were armed in White Armor, they being new Knights: the one, who was amorous of the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> had <hi>Hope</hi> painted in his Sheild, and the Princeſs gave him a Scarf as a Favor from her, and the other had a flaming Sword painted on his Shield, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when he was Knighted it was with a Sword that reſembled a Flame.</p>
                     <p>Being thus moſt richly armed and bravely mounted, after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Complemental expreſſions had paſſed between many of the Souldans Knights, and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his Companions, wiſhing them a proſperous ſucceſs in their intended Adventurs, they took their leave of all the fair Ladies, and only attended by <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> his two Dwarſs, they left <hi>Babylon</hi> and journeyed towards the <hi>Caſpian Sea.</hi>

                     <p>THrée days travelled <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his Companions without méeting with any Adventure and indeed he was not at all diſcontented thereat; for he was reſolved to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Commands of his Princeſs, and avoid all things that might hinder his Iourney: wherefore they travelled very hard, till within one days Iourney: of the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, they ſaw before them ſeveral Knights and Ladies journeying together,, but he being deſirous to avoid all company, rode on without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting them; whereupon a Damiel Riding after him, ſaid, I am come from one of thoſe Ladies yonder, who ſay that he who gave you the Order of Knighthood did not do well, in that he did not inſtruct you in your duty to Ladies when you méet them, and therefore deſires, if you be not in great haſt that you, or ſome of your company, would break a Lance with ſo me of her Knights, to the end ſhe may know whether you are better furniſhed with valor than with courteſie.</p>

She was no ſooner come to her Lady and delivered her Meſſage, but one of her Knights advanced towards them, which the <hi>Knight of the flaming Sword</hi> ſéeing, took a Lance and went to méet him. They ſoon couched their Lances and met each other with ſo much vigor, that they both loſt their Stirrops and broke their Lances, when taking new ones, at the next encounter the Ladies Knight meaſured hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49948:86"/>No ſooner was this done, but out came another Knight, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſince the <hi>Knight of the flaming Sword</hi> was well nigh down, that the <hi>Knight of Hope</hi> would try his fortune with him: To which he conſented, and thereupon they both couching their Lances, the <hi>Knight of Hope</hi> performed ſo well that the Ladies Knight mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured his length on the earth, and ſo he ſerved two more, but at laſt when he was running with the fourth Knight his Horſe tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and they both fell on the earth.</p>
                     <p>Then the <hi>Knight of the Boar</hi> ſtepping forwards, ran againſt the Knight who had diſmounted the <hi>Knight of Hope,</hi> and turned him off from his horſe: and often Knights there remained four who had not tryed their Valor, but he running againſt them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted them alſo.</p>

                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſéeing there was no more to be done, ſent his Dwarf to the Lady to preſent his ſervice to her, and hid him tell her, that the next time ſhe expected to compel Knights to Courteſie, ſhe muſt provide her ſelf with more valiant Defendants, which the Dwarf having done they all departed.</p>
                     <p>Thus did they travel on their Way all that day till they came near to the Sea-ſide, where they took up their Lodgings for that night on the ſhore. No ſooner was the Sun gotten up into the Firmament, but our Knights all aroſe, and Arming themſelves went to the Sea-ſide, where they met with their Ship, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they embarqued themſelves and horſes, and having a fair Wind they ſet Sayl and departed.</p>
                     <p>Long time ſayled they about this Sea, coaſting the Countrey, and landing in ſeveral places to enquire after news of the Souldan but all was in vain. One day a great Calmneſs happening, they ſayling very ſlowly, deſcried a Ship from afar off ſayling this therwards, wherefore command was given to the Mariners to bear up to them, which was done with all the expedition they could; when they came near the Ship they heard the voice of a Woman who made great lamentation: At which noiſe <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> wondring, cauſed them to call aboard to them, when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently two great Gyants armed at all points but their heads, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what they required? The <hi>Numidian</hi> anſwered, That they deſired to know the cauſe of the lamentation that they heaed. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49948:86"/>Gyants ſéeming very angry at his demand, replyed, That they might meddle with their own affairs for that did in no wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them.</p>

                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> hearing theſe proud ſpéeches, commanded the Ship to go néerer to the other and grapple with her. which was done accordingly, &amp; the Gyants clapping on their Helmets, drew their mighty Symitars to hinder the entrance of the Knights, who by the example of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> were all p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At this noiſe ten well armed Knights who were below, came up, &amp; drawing their Swords went to aſſail our Knights, who defended themſelves very bravely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſo ſtoutly laid about him, that he ſoon diſpatched four of them, and threw their bodies into the Sea: which the Gyants ſeeing made up to him, and gave him ſo firce a bloow on the Helmet, that he was aſtoniſhed, &amp; forced to lay both his hands on the ſide of the Ship to raiſe himſelf up: but he was no ſooner got on his ſéet but he buickly revenged that blow. and gave the Gyant ſuch a return, that lighting on his head he cut he Helmet quite in two pieces, and alſo his Head was cleaved down to the Iaws.</p>
                     <p>Thus this Gyant being diſpatched he turned him about to help his Companions, but he ſaw they had behaves themſelves ſo well that they had either killed or vanquiſhed all the Gyants Knights, wherefore he puting up his Sword, commanded the Mariners to conduct him to the place from whence they heard the noiſe, which they did acordingly: and being come thither ſaw a Damſel who made great lamentation, but he demanded of her the cauſe of hdr Complaint, ſhe aroſe, and ſeeing him knew him by his Armor, when falling on her knées, ſhe ſaid: Ah moſt courteous Knight! I now know that I am releaſed from the ſlavery and bondage I was going to having met with you, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> knew not the Damſel, wherefore raiſing her from the ground, he demanded of her how ſhe knew him; To which ſee replyed, I am confident Sir Knight, that I am not miſtaken in my knowledge of you, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt you moſt néeds be the valiant Prince <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> of Greece, of whoſe Proweſs and Vertue I am ſufficiently acquainted, wherefore know Sir, that I belong to the

                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> having heard this Relation, was very glad that he ſhould now be able to find the place whither he was to go, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thanked the Damſel very kindly for the pains and peril ſhe had undertaken for his ſake: and thereupon he cauſed her to go out of that Ship into his own, where ſhe was no ſooner come but ſhe eſpying the <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince, began to renew her lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; at which they all wondring, asked her the cauſe of her ſudden ſorrow? to which ſhe replyed, Ah, Sir Knight, when I came from my Miſtriſs ſhe gave into my cuſtody a Sword, which ſhe commanded me to preſent to her Couzin <hi>Baltaſano,</hi> which ſhe told me he would ere long ſtand in need of, for it had ſo hidden a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that it would make its way through any Armor, though it were enchanted, and told me that next to the Sword which you had it was the beſt in the world, and theſe two Giants when they took me, forced the Sword from me, and what they have done with it I know not.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince hearing of this was much troubled, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt it ſhould be loſt or thrown into the Sea with ſome of the dead Knights, wherefore he and the Damſel immediately went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ship to ſearch for it: ſo after a little ſearch they found it in one of the Cabins of the Giants, at which he was very glad; and ſo returning into the Ship of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> they ſhewed it to him, and the Sword was very plain, only the Hilt vvas made of entire Emerald.</p>
                     <p>This being done they deſired the Damſel to direct them to the place where the Souldan remained: but ſhe told them that if they would take her directions, they muſt firſt ſayl to the Mouth of the

They having heard this commanded the Mariners to obey her command, which they forthwith did, and ſet ſayl for the River <hi>Araxis.</hi> In few hours they came thither, and having informed the Damſel thereof, ſhe adviſed with the Maſter of the Veſſel, and told him that he muſt ſail croſs the Sea directly northwards, which he accordingly did: thus they leaving the Gyants Ship behind them, ſayled croſs that great Sea.</p>

                     <p>The Knight having given this Declaration to <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> left him and went forwards, and he ſtayed behind in a, very déep melancholly, conſidering the Eſtate of his fair Princeſs: but however he was ſomewhat joyful that he had this occaſion of ſerving her, hoping to do ſuch acts for the defence of the Empire, that the Souldan would be thereby induced to beſtow his daughter upon him, In this conſideration he was, when the Souldan and the reſt of the company overtaking him, asked him what was the occaſion of his leaving them, and what was his large Diſcourſe with the Knight?

                     <p>Madam, the trouble that I thought I ſhould put you to in recounting theſe Adventures, made me deſire to be excuſed in diſcourſing them to you; but if I had thought they would

The <hi>Black Knight</hi> ſéeing this, cryed out, Oh ye Gods! with how much force and valor have you endued one ſingle Knight?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> having done this execution, ſpurred on his beaſt, and more furiouſly than a baired Bull entred the Army of his Enemy, where he did kill and ſlay all that came within the reach, of his Sword. The <hi>Black Knight</hi> did the like, till at length he was encountred with by the <hi>Knight of Hope,</hi> who in deſpight of his reſolution to go forwards, made him ſtay and bravely receiv'd him: but the <hi>Black Knight</hi> being of admirable force and derterity ſo handled him, that in ſhort time he left him without ſenſe or motion, and ſo he departed and went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, killing and ſlaying all that had the valor to oppoſe him. Thus continued he a long time, till one came to him, and told him that his preſence would be very neceſſary in his own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for that the <hi>Knight of the Golden Image,</hi> and thoſe who followed him, had put one of the Squadrons of his Army to the rout, which he hearing preſently departed; and coming to the place where <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was, he ſaw him perform things incredible, for he was in purſuit of many Knights, none of them having ſo much reſolution as to turn their faces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, for if they did, they certainly met with their deaths.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor ſéeing this, was forced for the ſafety of his own men, to engage himſelf once more in Combate with him, which <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was not at all diſcontented at, but renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his forces, be likewiſe renew'd the Fight with him. Theſe two valiant Champions continued long in fight together, and gave to each other ſuch violent blows, that thoſe Forces that were there ſtood ſtill and forbore fighting, to behold them: But <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> whoſe match was not to be found throughout the whole Vniverſe, being angred that the Fight continued ſo long, gave the Emperor ſo mighty a blow on the arm, that he wounded him ſo mightily, that his ſword fell out of his hand; which <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſeeing, and intending to redouble his blow,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49948:97"/>was prevented: for many valiant Knights who had till then ſtood ſtill, ſéeing their Prince in ſo great danger, went and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cored him, and in deſpight of <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> carried him away to his Tent, where when his wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Thus the abſence of the Emperor cauſed <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his party to prevail: but although he behaved himſelf with great valor, and killed many Knights and Giants, yet their great numbers ſtill freſhly coming on, in the end tired him, ſo that when the night approached (he having continued the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel all that day) he withdrew his men, and contented himſelf with what he had done, for the next morning having taken an account of the numbers that he had loſt, he found that he wanted but fiftéen thouſand men, when on the enemies part were ſlain at leaſt fifty thouſand men.</p>
                     <p>That day the <hi>Knights of Hope,</hi> and of the <hi>Flaming Sword,</hi> did perform bravely, and not having ever béen in any Battel before, they by the example of their General performed excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently both in commanding and executing, and the Prince of <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> though a moſt valiant Knight, and much againſt his will, this day performed nothing, for he remained where his General had commanded him, and there was no occaſion to uſe that force that was under his command till it was night, and then they retreated in good order to the place where he was placed, and there taking up their quarters expected the aproach of the next mornings ſun to renew their fight.

At which aſſault he recovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and being enraged, with his ſword gave his adverſary ſo mighty a blow on the Helmet, that he bent his head to the horſes neck, and would have ſoon diſpatched him of his life, but that the <hi>Knight of Hope</hi> came timely enough to prevent him, and ſo received the blow, and returned it ſo fiercely on the Emperor, that he was wounded on the Thigh: and by this time the Prince of <hi>Meſapotamia</hi> had recoveerd his ſenſes and finding the danger he was delivered from, was firſt thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the heavens, and then revenged himſelf on one of the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who was next him, whoſe arm he cut off, and wounded him ſo in the ſide, that his life was ſacrificed to his revenge.</p>

When he came to them, he found that they had made a mighty reſiſtance, and that the Fight was very bloody; wherefore that he might exerciſe the part of a diſcréet General, and bring them off with the leaſt loſs, he knowing that there was a Bridge not far off, ſent to poſſeſs it: which when he had done, he commanded his Army to retire thither as faſt as they could, he himſelf, with the moſt valiant Knights of his whole Army making good the Rear as well as they could; but notwithſtanding all the diligence and valor that they could uſe, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and the Knights with him plied their buſineſs ſo well, that ere they got over the River many of them loſt their lives: At

                     <p>This being done, he diſpatched Meſſengers to inform the Souldan of what he had done, not forgetting to write to his Dear Princeſs, the remembrance of whom made him the more deſirous to put an end to theſe wars, that he might ſolace his ſpirits in her company. The Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> being thus forced to leave the field, and ſéeing that Fortune was a little contrary to him, yet being of an extraordinary courage, reſolved ſtill to perſevere in his enterpriſe, and not to leave off baſely, hoping in the end to attain his deſires, and in order to the ſtrengthning and recruiting his forces, he ſent tommands to thoſe Forces that were be hind, to await his coming to a City called <hi>Pharez,</hi> which was the firſt City in his Empire; which being accordingly done, one evening leaving ſome horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at the Rivers ſide, he raiſed his Camp and departed to <hi>Pharez,</hi> and the next day thoſe that he had left behind at the water followed him: He thus being arrived at the City, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd it both within and without, and ſent throughout his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to all places for help, reſolving to make that place the ſeat of war, for elſe he knew that the Souldans Forces would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him further.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>DOn Bellianis</hi> being very deſirous to do all that might be poſſible for the overcoming of his enemy, before any other help came to him, that he might acquire the more honor thereby, reſolved to ſet upon his enemies Camp, that was without the City, and (if poſſible) force them to retire into the City, that he might lay a cloſe Siege thereto, and ſo hinder them from going abroad for proviſions. In order to which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, after his men had reſted themſelves, he commanded them to provide to aſſault their enemies.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide the Emperor reſolving to abide him there, fook care for freſh ſupplies, for he not onely ſent through all his own Dominions for more help, but likewiſe ſent Ambaſſadors to thoſe Kings that were either his Friends or of his Alliance, ſuch as were the Kings of <hi>Albania, Georgia,</hi> and the Emperor of <hi>Muſoovia,</hi> deſiring them not to fail him in this occaſion, and the Ambaſſadors who went, made ſuch expedition, and had ſuch good ſucceſs in their Embaſſies, that the Emperor had great aſſiſtance, as you ſhall hear herafter. In the mean time, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had not onely a valiant, but a politick enemy to deal with, he kept ſtrict Guards hoth within and without the City, leſt he ſhould be ſurprized.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> notwithſtanding all the diligence he took, did ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49948:100"/>him; for having drawn out a Squadron of ſifty thouſand Knights, the moſt accompliſh'd in the whole army, cauſed them to put a piece of white ſilk, or cloth in their Helmets; that then might know one another though in the dark: and in the middle of the night, when his enemies expected no ſuch matter, he came to the Camp, and killing the Centinels, fell in among the Emperors Forces, and ſlew many of them before they could arm themſelves, and ſuch was their confuſion in the dark, that they without knowltdge ſlew one another, not knowing their enemies from their friends by reaſon of the darkneſs of the night, and their not being acquainted with his ſtratagem. In this manner he run through the Camy, and being followed by the beſt of his Army, came to the walls of the City, deſiring them to open, perſwading the Guards that they were of their own party, telling them that they muſt néeds ſpeak with the Emperor: but the Guards who had commands to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, went immediately to the Emperor and told him thereof, who ariſing from his bed, came to the wall, and then he very well underſtood that the Army was alarmed; wherefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to open the Gates, not knowing whether they were of his own Army or enemies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> perceiving this, and that it would be to little purpoſe to continue there, departed, and ſo returned thorough the enemies Camp, killing and ſlaying all that were in his way, and ſo being gone throught the Camy and paſſed all the Guards, he cauſed the retreat to be ſounded; which his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers hearing, ſoon underſtood the meaning thereof, and ſo left the Camp and came to him; who when they were come, fairly retreated to their own Quarters; But <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> who had an intent to ſurprize the City, and failing therein, as you have heard, was ſome what vexed: but however he conſidered that he had done them a ſufficient miſchief, for he had killed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty thouſand of his enemies, and came off with the loſs of not above five hundred men.</p>
                     <p>This action gave the Emperor a ſenſible diſpleaſure, and did reſolve if poſſible to revenge it, but he could not at preſent put his reſolves into execution, wherefore he gave ſtrict command
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49948:101"/>to keep double Guards; and more ſtrict Watches, hoping in ſhort time to have ſuch aid that he might be able not onely to revenge that loſs, but to beat his Forces out of the field: But before any Forces came to his aſſiſtance, <hi>Baltaſano</hi> Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> arrived at the Camp of <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> with one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand men, and with new Orders from the Souldan, that if the Emperor would pay the coſt of the War, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band his Forces, that then he ſhould have peace, otherwiſe that they ſhould proſecute the War againſt him to the utmoſt; ſuch was the deſire and inclination that the Souldan had for peace</p>
                     <p>Theſe Orders much troubled <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> being bery diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented that the War muſt end, and that he could not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the life of his Rival, fearing him ſo long as he ſhould live, leſt he ſhould ſo propound the having of the Princeſs <hi>Floris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> as the Souldan ſhould accept of it, and indéed when the propoſitions were ſent to the Emperor, he was willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of them provided he might have the Princeſs for his wife, otherwiſe he would ſtand to the utmoſt hazard of the war, not queſtioning but by the help of his Allies and Friends, but that he ſhould not onely be able to beat his enemies out of his Countrey, but to aſſault them in theirs, and give them ſuch trouble that the Souldan would be willing to propound his Daughter for a compoſition of the War.</p>
                     <p>This anſwer being returned to the two Generals, <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis</hi> and <hi>Baltaſano,</hi> diſpleaſed them bath, but the anger that <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was in at this propoſition was ſo great, that I am not able to expreſs it; for riſing from the place where he ſate, he delivered this anſwer to the Meſſenger:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Go tell thy Maſter, that ſo long as the Souldan of <hi>Babylon</hi> has Subjects in his whole Empire, that he ſhall never compel him to ſuch baſeneſs as the proſtituting his moſt Royal Daughter to one ſo baſe and unworthy: and were all the Treaſure of the Souldan exhauſted, all his Subjects ſlain, and none left in his whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to defend him, yet I would command ſuch an Army from other parts in defence of the Royal Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> as ſhould not onely be able to expel thy Maſter from the Souldans Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but alſo to deſtroy him, and all his in the very heart of his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49948:101"/>own Kingdom. And tell thy Maſter, that ſince he hath neglected the gracious and favourable Propoſitions of the Souldan, that he now expect no more, but prepare himſelf for all the misfortunes that a cruel and bloody War can bring him: And tell him, that I the <hi>Knight of the Golden Image,</hi> do reſolve when next I meet him, to bereave him of his life or loſe my own in the attempt, and hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I bid him mortal battel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was the Anſwer of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> and it was ſpoken with ſo much fierceneſs, that the very fice iſſued out of his eyes for anger, and he could hardly utter his words for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vexation that he took at the Demands of the Emper or. Thus the Meſſenger being returned, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and <hi>Balta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſano</hi> reſolved both to aſſault him on the next day, and uſe their utmoſt endeavors to gain the City, and thereupon they provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all things ready for an Aſſault.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49948:102"/>notwithſtanding all her ſorrow in her travels, ſhe appeared to be one of the moſt handſome Princeſſes in the world: Dinner being ended, every one reſorted to the Tilt-Yard, which was near the Pallace, where a Scaffold was erected, and on that was placed two Chairs of State for the King and Quéen to ſit and behold the Tournaments and Feats of Chivalry that was to be performed.</p>

                        <hi>Don Clarineo, Don Lucidamore, Don Contumeliano,</hi> and <hi>Flioriſpiano,</hi> and a young Knight called <hi>Trion,</hi> or the <hi>Knight of the Wolf,</hi> who was Son to <hi>Damartino</hi> the late Governor, were the Challengers, who undertook to Iouſt, and kéep the Field againſt all comers for ſix days, and accordingly they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed at all points, entred the Liſts, and commanded the Trumpets to ſound, and the Herald to proclaim, that if there were any adventurous Knights that would in honor of the King and Quéen break a Lance, they were there ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; which was no ſooner done, but there came a Knight armed in white Armor, who taking a Lance entred the Liſts, and expected the ſound of the Trumpet that he might begin his Courſe: the <hi>Knight of the Wolf</hi> did the like, and they bravely méeting brake their Lances in the encounter, and ſo paſſed on; at the next encounter the <hi>Knight of the Wolf</hi> had ſo good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as to overthrow the other Knight out of the Saddle, and paſſed on being unſhaken, and expected another Aſſaylant, when preſently another Knight armed in Azure Armor entred the Liſt, and doing his obeyſance to the King and Quéen, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the encounter, which was ſo fierce that he loſt both his ſtirrops, and the horſe of the <hi>Knight of the Wolf</hi> was on his buttocks, but he ſoon made him riſe and ſo went bravely on, when taking another Lance, and reſolving to be revenged of his late diſgrace, he ran ſo fiercely againſt the Knight in the Azure Armor, that he ſent him from his horſe to the ground with his Saddle betwéen his legs.</p>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49948:102"/>the King and Quéen, pranced about the field with great grates at laſt he arrived at the end of the Liſts, and taking a Lance from one of his Pages, at the ſound of the Trumpets began his Careſs, and peoform'd ſo wel that he made the <hi>Knight of the Wolf</hi> loſt both his ſtirrops, he being very little ſhaken with the encounter: At the ſecond courſe the <hi>Knight of the Wolf in</hi> revenge of the former blow, ran ſo fiercely that he threw the <hi>Solitary Knight</hi> horſe and man both to the earth: at which there was a great ſhout.</p>
                     <p>And thus did the <hi>Knight of the Wolf</hi> throw many Knights from their horſes, ſo that he that day diſmounted ſixtéen, and the night coming on they left off that ſport, and retiring into the Court, they diſarming themſelves, fell to dancing: In which exerciſe they were as perfect as the other, ſo that they are as fit for <hi>Venus</hi> as <hi>Mars.</hi> Much of the evening they ſpent in theſe kind of exerciſes, but at length they left off, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the King and Quéen to Bed, where the fair Princeſs gave to <hi>Don Brianel</hi> as full and frée poſſeſſion of her Body, as he had formerly given her of her Kingdom, and there he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a full ſatisfaction for all the travels he had ſuſtained in her ſervice.</p>

                     <p>To which the <hi>Knight of the Keys</hi> courteouſly replied, Sir Knight, I am known by no other Name than the <hi>Knight of the Keys,</hi> and to tell you any other Name would little ſatisfie you, for I was born in a Countrey ſo far from hence, that it hath ſeldom here béen heard of; and Ile aſſure you I came hither by accident, and never was in your company, nor in this place before till this day, and therefore if you have nothing elſe to ſay to me, let us procéed with our Lances. To which the Prince of <hi>Phenicia</hi> replyed, I to my experience know, Sir Knight, that you do perform very well with the Lance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray grant this Requeſt, that if we chance both to break one or two Lances without any effect, and neither of us have any advantage, that you will procéed to the Sword where we may have more oceaſion to try our valors. To this Requeſt the <hi>Knight of the Keys</hi> conſented, and ſo they forthwith brake off their diſcourſe, and began their Caréer.</p>

                     <p>At the age of eightéen years he being dubbed Knight, begged leave of his Father to ſéek Adventures: to which his Parents hardly conſented, in regard he was the onely Comfort and Ioy of their old Age: but his importunity prevailing, providing himſelf of things neceſſary, he cauſed a ſtrong Suit of Armor to be made, and in reſpect his name was <hi>Peter,</hi> in remembrance of that holy Saint and Apoſtle, he cauſed two Keys to be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on his Shield: And providing himſelf of all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary for ſo great a Voyage as he intended to take, he took his leave of his Parents, his Mother giving him thrée rich jewels at his departure, and her Bleſſing, and ſo he departed, taking ſhipping for <hi>England,</hi> where he arrived and performed many valiant Déeds of Arms: but his reſolution being to ſée ſtrange and far Countreys, he took ſhipping again, and croſſing over the narrow Seas arrived in <hi>France,</hi> where at the Court of that King he performed brave Feats at Arms at the Marriage of one of the Noblemens Daughters.</p>
                     <p>And leaving a great fame of his Valor behind him, he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled through all <hi>France:</hi> and arriving at <hi>Marſellis</hi> he again embarqued himſelf, intending to ſayl to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there to ſpend ſome time in ſéeking out Adventures: but as he was ſayling thither, the Ship was forced to put in at an Iſland called <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and being advertiſed that a great Feaſt was held there in Honor of the Kings Coronation Day, and that there was many Knight who approv'd their valors in running a Tilt, and ſuch kind of honorable Exerciſes, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſpend ſome time amongſt them; which he did to his great advantage, for he ſo well demeaned himſelf that he got the ſole honor of the Tournament, and he carried himſelf ſo courteouſly to all, that he not onely got the good will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the King and Quéen, but alſo of their Daughter the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Magdalena,</hi> who was ſo wounded by the little God <hi>Cupid</hi> that ſhe knew not what to do: in vain was it to ſmother her affection, which ſhe ſtrived by all means poſſible to do, but could not, ſo that an ancient woman her Nurſe with whom ſhe had béen bred, did diſcover that ſomewhat was the matter more than ordinary with hee Miſtreſs, and although ſhe uſed many
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49948:105"/>ways to finde what ſhould be the matter, yet ſhe failed in all, till at length the Princeſs not being any longer able to ſmother her affection, diſcovered it to her Nurſe, begging of her not onely to kéep it concealed, but alſo to give her the beſt advice that ſhe could.</p>
                     <p>The Nurſe now knowing the Diſeaſe of her Miſtreſs began to apply Remedies, and like a diſcréet perſon told her, that it was altogether unfit for her who was the Daughter of a King and ſo great a Beauty as ſhe was, that the greateſt Princes in the world might account themſelves happy in the enjoyment of her, that ſhe ſhould ſet her love and affection on a ſimple Knight, one who was but a private perſon, and it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known whether he was nobly deſtended, or not.</p>
                     <p>To which the Princeſs ſoon replied, That ſhe was confident he was not of mean Parentage, but of Princely Birth, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Princely Endowments and Qualifications that ſhe ſaw he was endowed with; and therefore if ſhe would do her any ſervice it muſt be in this occaſion, to find ſome way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him, and gain ſome knowledge of him from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for ſhe was reſolved in her love, and that it could not any ways be diverted.</p>
                     <p>The Nurſe ſéeing this, deſired her to ſmother her paſſions as well as ſhe could, that the King and Quéen might not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any thing from her, and that ſhe would take ſome ſpéedy occaſion to give her ſome ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>In theſe tearms ſhe left the Princeſs, who promiſed to be guided herein by her addice, and ſought opportunity to ſpeak to the Knight, which ſhe ſoon found, for he was ſo déeply in love with the Princeſs, as ſhe was with him, and deſired nothing more than to have an opportunity to ſpeak to this old Lady, who he ſaw was very converſant with the Princeſs, and did believe was her Confident. They being both equally deſirous of one and the ſame thing, méeting together ſhe began to him thus:</p>

                        <hi>Sir Knight, I much marvel that you keep your ſelf ſo concealed for I know very well that the King, Queen, and the fair Princeſs <hi>Magdalena,</hi> would be very glad to know your Linage, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,

                        <hi>That ſince his departure from his Parents he had not diſcovered himſelf to any, and that the Princeſs ſhould command more from him than any perſon in the World: but ſhe muſt excuſe him in this particular, onely you may certifie her in general, that I am born of Princely Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>She in all haſte coming to the Princeſs, gave her the effects of her diſcourſe, and the Iewel; at which ſhe was extreamly ſatisfied, and ſtill was every day more and more entangled and enſnared in the bonds of Love: and thereupon ſhe cauſed the old Lady to have another Conference with him. At which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Conference he told her, that if the Princeſs would be pleaſed to grant him private acceſs to her, he would give her a ſatisfactory account of his Eſtate and Condition: the which the old Lady promiſed to effect, and thereupon he gave her ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iewel to preſent to the Princeſs in his behalf, which ſhe did accordingly, and then the Princeſs was more ſatisfied than before, longing for the appointed time when he was to come: which prefixed time being come, he accordingly ca me to viſit her, and was admitted into her Preſence, where after his Civilities tendered to her, he diſcovered himſelf to her, and of what Linage he was, and not onely ſo, but ſéeing how mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters went, he diſcovered his Love to her: at which ſhe was not at all diſcontented, but told him of hers to him, to the great ſatisfaction of them both; and there they ſo ordered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they concluded to be at the diſpoſe of one another du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life, and he in teſtimony of his love gave her another Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, more worth than both the former; all which he had, as I told you ormerly received of his Mother: and ſhe in return
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49948:106"/>took a Gold Chain from her Neck, and beſtowed it upon him; the which he received in hearty good will. All this was done in private, not ſo much as the old Lady being preſent; and when they has thus done and the old Lady was come, after many farewels, though unwilling, he departed.</p>
                     <p>This buſineſs being thus concluded on, he lived long time in the Court, and ſtill was in the ſame credit with the King and Quéen. At length he was reſolved further to try the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of his Princeſs, and thereupon took an opportunity to ſpeak to her, and told her that now he had béen there a long time, and ſaw no way how to gain the good will of her Father and Mother, and therefore reſolved to go home and viſit his Parents. At which diſcourſe ſhe was much troubled, for her great love to him would not permit of any ſeparation, but ſhe rather reſolved to leave Father and Mother, and all her friends than be without him, and therefore it was reſolved that ſhe ſhould go with him, and he prepared a ſmall Barque to that purpoſe: which when it was ready at the time appointed, he in company of his Princeſs entred, ſhe taking with her a good quantity of Gold and Iewels, and ſo they departed and left <hi>Sardinia,</hi> with a reſolution to go towards his own Countrey.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner were they gone, but the Princeſs was miſſed at Court, and the King after ſome enquiry, hearing which way they were gone, ſent ſeveral Ships after them, but it was in vain; for a Tempeſt had forced the Barque in which the Knight and the Princeſs were, quite another way, and drove them on ſhore at another Iſland called <hi>Sicillia,</hi> where their Barque being ſplit they got on ſhore, being both glad and ſorry for their good and ill fortune, where the Lady after ſome travel by land to find a houſe where to repoſe themſelves, being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, fate down, and drawing forth a little red Purſe, ſhewed her Knight the thrée Iewels he had given her: at which he was joyful that ſhe had not left them behind; and laying it by her, ſhe being very weary, fell aſléep, and he lay lovingly by her; but ſome ravenous Fowl flying by, and ſéeing the red Purſe, ſuppoſing it to be a piece of fleſh, deſcended from thy Sky and took it up, which the Knight ſéeing, and knowing what it was,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49948:106"/>aroſe, looking to ſée whither the Fowl would fly, which did ſoon alight on a Trée, but he ſoon followed her, and diſturbed her by throwing ſtones at her, till he forced her to fly away with the Purſe; he being more angry than before, ſtill followed her, and ſhe flying towards the water ſide, he ſtill purſued her with ſtones, which the Bird perceiving, at length let the Purſe fall into the Sea, but it was in ſo ſhallow a place that he could ſée it lye at the bottom, but could not come at it, it being a great way in the water: he attempted many ways to come at it, at laſt he diſcovered an old Boat hard by, to which he repaired, and finding a ſtaff therein, he intended to puſh the Boat to the place where the Purſe lay, to the end he might recover it: which he could not do, for the Boat coming into the ſtrength of the ſtream, in deſpight of all he could do, he was carried a great way from the place where he took Boat, and at length he came into the main Sea, when, though too late, he would have thrown himſelf into the Sea, if by that means he could have got on ſhore. Thus was his Princeſs left alone on ſhore, ſléep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an unknown Land, of whoſe miſery we ſhall hereafter ſpeak more.</p>
                     <p>But now we return to him who made heavy complaints not onely for his own misfortune, but that of his Princeſs: And thus his Boat was at the mercy of the Sea for thrée days, he expecting every moment when he and the Boat ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the Sea; but his Deſtiny having prepared him for better fortunes, at laſt he was forced by the impetuouſneſs of the waves, on a little Iſland in the Mediterranean Seas, called <hi>Zanie,</hi> where when he came on ſhore, he praiſed God for his ſafe deliverance from the Sea, not without many tears for the loſs of his dear Princeſs. There when he had in ſome manner recovered his health, which was impaired by his long faſting, he hired a ſmall Ship to ſearch up and down all the Iſlands of the <hi>Archiepelago</hi> to find his Princeſs out, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the name of the place where he had loſt her: but all was in vain, for he had loſt her quite another way.</p>
                     <p>Thus being croſſed at his ill fortune, he at laſt landed at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and then not caring whither he went, ſuch was his
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49948:107"/>ſorrow for the loſs of his dear Princeſs: His deſtinies after many weary Iourneys, at laſt brought him to <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he arrived at the Triumphs held for the Solemnization of the Wedding of the King and Quéen, and there he performed ſuch Knightly Déeds of Chivalry, as hath béen told you in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter.</p>
                     <p>The next day after the Combate betwéen the <hi>Knight of the Keys</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Phenicia,</hi> all the Champions reſorted early into the Liſts, and there the two Knights deſtred of the King to give them leave to finiſh their Combate: but the King would not aſſent thereto, but ordered that they ſhould both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt there-from; and in regard there had béen ſo much equalling in the Knights both at the Lance and Sword, neither of them ſhould be accounted Vanquiſhed, or Vanquiſher; and that they ſhould neither of them come into the Field all the following days of the Tournament, but that the two Knights <hi>Don Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineo,</hi> and <hi>Don Lucidamore</hi> ſhould kéep the Field onely; which at laſt they all aſſented to, and they pecformed it to their great honor: for in that time they diſmonuted many hardy Knights but ſtill kept the honor of the Field till all the days of the Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament were accompliſhed.</p>

                     <p>The Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> with a Party of fifty thouſand men rode up and down the Field, to give his aſſiſtance to that part or place where there was moſt néed: and there was one party of the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond's</hi> Foof-ſoldiers of about fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, who kept cloſe together, and did much harm to his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, being commanded and guarded by ten ſtrong Gyants, whom the <hi>Numidian</hi> attempted to diſperſe, but they were all ſo reſolute that he could not break through their Ranks; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he attempted them a new way, and retiring from them firſt, ordered his Squadrons in the faſhion of a Wedge, the Front not being above twenty Knights, but the Rear was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove five hundred men broad, and he in the Head of this party forced with his twenty Knights into the ranks of his enemies Squadron, and maugre all the reſiſtance of the Gyants and the reſt, he went into the body of the Army, and being gone ſo far, the reſt followed him, till at length the Rear of his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron opening to the right and left, and ſo whéeling about both ways, encompaſſed the Enemies Squadron, engaging them in Front, Rear, Flanks and Middle, and indéed on all ſides at one and the ſame time, he had ſuch ſucceſs that in ſhort time he killed moſt of them, ſo that of fifty thouſand men there was not left one thouſand aſide.</p>

This being done, they fortified themſelves in their Enemies Entrenchments, the two Generals reſolving not onely to continue cloſe Siege to the City, but alſo to aſſault them there, ſetting Pionéers to work to undermine ſome part of the City-wall, that they might make a breach and ſo enter to them, and all the other ways that they could invent or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine they put in practice: but the deſign at that time was hindred, for the City was ſoon after relieved by the arrival of freſh Supplies, as ſhall be hereafter declared to you.

                           <p>Since my arrival with your Forces I have been indlfferently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, for I have not onely ſatisfied the mindes of your own Subjects in the way that I marched, but have alſo received much aid by their voluntary aſſiſtance, which I accepted of according to the Orders that you ſent me, and we have had ſome Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Enemy to a very good advantage; for we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to leave your Countrey, part of which he was entred into and retire into his own with much loſs and diſadvantage. The Arrival of the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> was very importunely done, for we were then engaging the Enemy, who is ſo wilfully reſolute, that without the aid he brought we ſhould have had ſome diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                           <pb n="126" facs="tcp:49948:110"/>
                           <p>The Offers of Peace you ſent were tendred to the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond,</hi> but he in hopes of Aſſiſtance from his Neighboring Kings, is ſtill reſolute to proceed in the War, unleſs he may have the Princeſs your Daughter offered up to him. Which Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his we wholly declined, and ſuch is the anger of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects at his Arrogancy in propounding things ſo unreaſonable, that rather than their Princeſs ſhall be expoſed to a thing ſo diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her inclination, they will all loſe their lives. If, Sir, you continue in this opinion (as I hope your Imperial Majeſty will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver condeſcend to a thing ſo baſe and mean, as the Proſtitution of your Daughter, to have peace with your Enemy) I then queſtion not but to force your Enemy to very good terms, and much to your advantage. If the aid the Emperor expects does come in to him, it will occaſion the lengthning of the War, and you ſome trouble to ſend freſh ſupplies, which I queſtion not your readineſs to perform; And Sir, aſſure your ſelf, that in ſo juſt a cauſe as this, I ſhall not onely hazard my own perſon to the utmoſt perils, but rather than condeſcend to any thing that is baſe, I ſhall be able of my ſelf to raiſe ſuch Friends as ſhall bring me two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men to juſtifie this Quarrel, and be revenged of your unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Enemies: But I hope, Sir, e're any freſh Supplies come to the Enemy, that we ſhall be able to compel him to put an end to this War: And aſſure your ſelf that all my utmoſt endeavors ſhall not be wanting in execution of this publick Affair, as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I have been ready to hazard my Perſon in the preſervation of your Majeſty, and that of your Family, and I ſhall think my ſelf ſufficiently ſatisfied, if for all my trouble and travel you will do me the honor to permit me to be a ſervant to You and your Family, and more particularly to be admitted by your fair Daughter as a Servant to her Vertues; In expectation of which I ſhall account nothing dear, ſo as I may be admitted for her Champion, and I queſtion not but I ſhall give a ſatisfaction to you all; which I make my reſolve to do, or die</p>

                     <p>Great ſatisfaction did this Letter give to the Souldan, not onely for the good ſucceſs that his Forces had already obtained, but for their reſolution to continue conſtant to him: He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that he had great cauſe to be thankful to the <hi>Knight of the Baſilisks</hi> (for ſo he was called at the Court, being unknown by any other Name there:) he had béen much bound to him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready for delivering him and his Daughter from the Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Tent, as it was ſet down in the firſt Book of this Hiſtory, for the aſſiſtance he had given to his Couſin the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Aurora,</hi> in helping her to her Kingdom of <hi>Antioch;</hi> for his delivering his Couſin the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> and her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prince of <hi>Numidia,</hi> from the power of the Gyant <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifer</hi> and his Companions, and more eſpecially for releaſing him from the Enchantment in the Iſland, to the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great peril of his perſon, and now at laſt he was engaged in a long and troubleſom War, and had performed very well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in it, and had ſent him his reſolutions to perſiſt therein, and all the advantage he deſired and propounded to himſelf for all theſe ſo ſignal Services, was onely to be admitted a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and Champion to his Daughter, whoſe Cauſe he was now fighting in.</p>
                     <p>Theſe he thought ſo reaſonable, that he immediately ſent for his Daughter, and being reſolved to do nothing as to her perſon without her conſent, he cold her the effect of the Knights Letter, and withal informed her with his Requeſt, deſiring her that if it were not wholly againſt her inclination, that ſhe would grant the Requeſt of the Knight.</p>
                     <p>She who was as deſirous of this as he was, and had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a good will, but an extraordinary affection for him, anſwered her Father, That ſhe conſidered the Obligations they were all boound to the <hi>Knight of the Baſilisks</hi> in were ſo many, and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſhe was ready to do that, as alſo any thing elſe that her Father ſhould deſire that would give ſatisfaction to the <hi>Knight of the Baſilisks,</hi> who ſhe ſaid, ſhe believed was ſent by the Gods for the preſervation of her and all her Family, and was certainly the Titular Angel of their Countrey. And ſhe further added, that were ſhe knowing of the Birth and Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49948:111"/>and that it were equal to hers, and the good Will of her Father and Friends joyned to her own Inclination, ſhe ſhould do that willingly for him which the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to force her to, ſo greatly was ſhe ſatisfied, not onely in the Courage and Magnanimity, but alſo in the Vertues of the <hi>Knight of the Baſilisks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When ſhe had ſaid thus ſhe held her peace, and ſomewhat bluſhed that ſhe had ſo plainly diſcovered her affection to her Father: but ſhe was ſomewhat ſatisfied when her Father gave her this reply, That he was wholly of her opinion, and that he queſtioned not but that one ſo well accompliſhed, was likewiſe of an Illuſtrious Birth; and that he would endeavor to ſatisfie himſelf in his Birth, in the mean time he adviſed his Daughter to write to the Knight, and give him ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, ſuch as ſhe ſhould think fit: And he ſaid, he queſtioned not but he was of an extraordinary Quality, for he propounded the raiſing two hundred thouſand men to fight under him in this Service.</p>
                     <p>This was the diſcourſe betwéen the Emperor and his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which being ended ſhe retired into her Cloſet, where ſhe was expected by her Couſin the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Letters from <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> one for her ſelf, and another for her Couſin. When the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> came there, ſhe found her Couſin reading of that to her ſelf, but ſhe quickly left off that to deliver the other to her Couſin: which ſhe no ſooner received, but ſhe opened the Seal, and found therein written as followeth.</p>

My Sword hath been exerciſed in the deſtruction of your Enemies, and indeed we

The Propoſitions your Father ſent were not accepted of, though very reaſonable, and the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> is ſtill ſo preſumptious, as to deſire your Perſon in marriage, and upon theſe terms he will leave the War; and this he queſtions not to force you to do by the help of more Forces he is raiſing, and by the Aid he expects from ſome of his Alliance: how pleaſant this Propoſition was you may eaſily judge, and that be might as well have ſaid that we ſhould all ſuffer our ſelves to be ſlain without any reſiſtance, and I for my part ſhould ſooner have conſented to that, than this ſo unjuſt command.

                     <p>But the Kings of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> who were arrived within thrée Leagues of the City, and heard that they muſt fight their way through the Souldans Army, prepared for the Encounter, and ſo in good order marched on until they arrived within ſight of each other, and then <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and <hi>Baltaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> with fifty thouſand well approved Knights likewiſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to méet them, where they ſoon encountred one anothar.</p>
                     <p>The two Kings of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> being both valiant and redoubted knights, couching their Lances went to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the two Generals, the Princes of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Numidia,</hi> who likewiſe couching their Lances ran againſt them, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Lances without much prejudice to one another, they paſſed on, and ſo both Armies joyned to mortal Batrel, where great was the noiſe of the ſound of Trumpets and all manner of other warlike Inſtruments, and the claſhing of Armor: but greater was the terror that the two brave Generals <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and <hi>Baltaſano</hi> gave to their Enemies where ever they came; for whoever came within the reach of their well-cutting Swords; did pay dearly for that preſumption. The two Kings of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> did likewiſe behave themſelves like hardy Knights, and valiant and diſcreet Generals, for their great and valorous Déeds gave both encouragement and valor to their followers. Very bloody was the Fight when News came to <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> to advertiſe him, that the Emperor with great Forces was come out of the City, and had aſſaulted
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49948:114"/>his Camp. At which News he went to <hi>Baltaſano,</hi> and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing him thereof, they concluded that the preſence of one of them would be very neceſſary, and therefore <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> out of the deſire he had to be revenged on his Enemy and Rival the Emperor, thoſe to go thither and leave the Prince of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia</hi> to continue the Fight: which being agréed on he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly departed, and arriving at his Camp he found that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had made a valiant Aſſault, and that they had béen as well reſiſted by the two valiant Knights, the <hi>Knight of Hope,</hi> and the <hi>Knight of the Flaming Sword,</hi> who were fighting valiantly in the midſt of the Emperors Forces: <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſeeing that encouraged them by his preſence, and ſo departed to find out the Emperor, who at length he overtook, and knowing him by the many hardy ſtroakes he ſaw him deliver, he cryed out to him, Sir Knight, you will gain more honor by leaving thoſe people and fighting with me, who am reſolved to conques you or die. The Emperor hearing theſe words, ſoon turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſée who had béen ſo hardy as to ſpeak them: but he was ſoon ſatisfied when he ſaw they were uttered by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Knight of the Baſilisks;</hi> wherefore leaving his other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies he came towards <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> and ſo they both making their ways through the Ranks of their Armies, joyned in fight together.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor heated in battel, gave <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> a mighty blow over the Helmet, but he ſoon requited it by returning him another on the ſhoulder, which deſcending, wounded him on the Arm. Thus was the Fight on all ſides vigorouſly proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted: But the Kings of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> being wholly deſirous to force their way into the City, made it their whole buſineſs to get thither, and ſo by degrées they got ground, till at length both the. Armies came in ſight of one another, and then the Emperors Forces ſéeing that they were likely to be ſo well relieved, gave a great ſhout, and joyned all their Forces together: the noiſe that they made gave ſome diſquiet to <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> who was ſtill fighting with the Emperor, and being deſirous to know what was the matter, he reached the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſo mighty a blow that he remained without féeling, and ſo
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49948:115"/>he turned his horſe towards the place from whence the noiſe came, and then he ſoon diſcovered that the occaſion of it was the arrival of the two Kings into the Army with their aſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. He preſently rode furiouſly through all the Ranks of his Enemies, doing much execution, till h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the mean time the Emperor being frée endeavored to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Forces, and ſo coming to the Kings of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Georgia,</hi> after ſome Complements, he deſired them likewiſe to draw off their Forces, which being done they all retired into the City, but with the loſs of twenty thouſand men, <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis</hi> and his Forces following them to the very Gates. When they were entered the City, the Emperor conduced the two Kings to the Pallace, where be entertaind them and gave them many thanks for this their aid and aſſiſtance, and then they concluded to reſt their Forces for two days, and by that time the Emperor told them he was confident he ſhould not only have aid from the Emperor of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> but likewiſe more of his own, and ſo ſoon as they were arrived he intended to take the Field, not queſtioning but he ſhould quickly force the Enemy to leave his Countrey.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> retired up to their Camp, and reſolved very ſuddenly to give them a general Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault: but the next day the Forces of the Emperor of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> arrived, and in deſpight of <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> entrenched themſelves and kept the Field. The Emperor being thus well relieved,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49948:115"/>reſolved now to take the Field, and give a Field-battel to his Enemies, which he concluded to do the next day: and in order thereunto, early the next morning he with one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men under his own Conduct iſſued out of the City, one hundred thouſand men under the Conduct of the two Kings of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Georgia,</hi> and fifty thouſand men under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Knight of the Tyger,</hi> Kinſman to the Emperor of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> who had brought thoſe Forces thither.</p>
                     <p>In this equipage the Emperor was in the Field, and on the other ſide the two Generals <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and <hi>Baltaſano,</hi> divided their Forces onely into two parts, and reſolving on all ſides to fight valiantly and conquer their Enemies, they bravely aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led each other: Bloody was the Fight in all places, ſo that ſoon was the Fields gréen Apparel turned into purple. The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals on all ſides performed wonders: the Emperor on his part did very valiantly, reſolving to get the Field or never return to the City: and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> being reſolved this day to ſhew the invincibleneſs of his Courage, he being accompanied by five hundred Knights, as his Guard, in deſpight of all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion forced his way into the Camp of his Enemies, where with his own Arm he ſoon killed fifty Knights, and thoſe who followded him imitating his Example, ſlew many of their Enemies.</p>
                     <p>The Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> had likewiſe in another place forced his way into his Enemies Camp, and there he encountred the <hi>Knight of the Tyger,</hi> who was encompaſſed with ten ſtrong Gyants, but maugre all their oppoſition he furiouſly forced his way through them, and aſſaulted the <hi>Knight of the Tyger</hi> with ſo mighty a blow on the head, ſo that he was not onely aſtoniſhed, but the Sword falling on the horſe his head, cleved him down right, and he fell down dead under his Maſter. The Gyants who were near him ſoon aſſiſted him, and mounted him on another horſe. but it coſt two of them their lives, the one being ſlain by the Prince of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and the other by the <hi>Knight of Hope,</hi> who was now arrived with ſome Forces to the place where <hi>Baltaſano</hi> was, and then they all joyned Forces, and the <hi>Knight of the Tyger</hi> being very valiant, revenged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49948:116"/>by the loſs of the lives of many of his Enemies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> having run through his Enemies Camp with great fury, returned and rode up and down to finde out his Rival the Emperor, whom at length he found out and encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and many fierce ſtrokes were given to one another, the Emperor reſolving to revenge himſelf on <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> ſhewed the utmoſt of his skill and courage, and gave him a blow on the Thigh, ſo that the blood iſſued out thereat through the Ioynts of his Armor: he was greatly enraged hereat, and gave the Emperor another wound on the ſide: thus they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued fighting together, till at length the multitudes of both Parties came to aſſault each other parted them, and then they ranged about the Field killing and deſtroying many Knights.</p>
                     <p>It was now the Noon day, and the Fight had continued eight hours, and yet there was not much advantage on either ſide, till they heard the ſound of Trumpets, and at ſome diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they might perceive freſh Forces enter the Field, but to which they belonged it was yet unknown: at length they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ſight, and then by their Colours they were known to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Emperor, and indéed they were forty thouſand men under the Conduct of the <hi>Knight of Fame,</hi> Nephew to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who hearing of the Fight made haſte thither, thinking to get Honor in the Battel, but he fared not ſo well as he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as we ſhall declare to you anon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſéeing this, quickly drew out forty thouſand of his men and went to méet him, and taking a new Lance couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame, and ran fvriouſly againſt his Enemy, who did the like, but not with the ſame advantage; for <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> onely loſt one of his ſtirrops, but his Enemy came horſe and man to the ground. He ſoon recovered himſelf, and being angry at his misfortune, revenged himſelf by the death of ſix Knights, whom he ſoon killed or overthrew: thus was theſe two Battels joyned, but <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſoon abated ſome of the vigor of his Enemies, by the puiſſant and mighty ſtrokes he gave them, killing ten Knights ere he brake his Lance, and then drawing his Sword he ſoon after ſent twenty Knights more to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49948:116"/>their Companions, ſo that now they were not ſo furious to aſſault him as they had béen: He quickly made his way through all his Squadron, and having teſtified to them his ſtrength and valor, returned and went to aſſault the <hi>Knight of Fame,</hi> who was now engaged with his Enemies: but at the arrival of <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> they ſoon gave way to him, and he trached him a mighty blow on the head, ſo that his Helmet flew from his head, and he was likewiſe wounded, and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> intending to give him a ſecond blow, was prevented; for two furious Gyants oppoſed themſelves to him: but he who was uſed to deal well enough with theſe ſort of people ſoon let them know his valor by the cutting off one of their legs.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> had recovered another Helmet, and came to revenge himſelf on <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> ſo that now he was engaged both by a Gyant and the <hi>Knight of Fame,</hi> but he did will enough to maintain the fight with them both. In the mean time the two Kings of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> had engaged themſelves among their Enemies, and at laſt they arrived where the Emperor was engaged, but they brought him ſuch Aid that he cauſed the Souldans Forces to retire, and many of them loſt their lives, ſo that they being without any valiant Commander did in a manner fly: this gave great encouragement to the Emperor and the two Kings, and they purſued them ſome way, till they ſaw a Body of men afar off who came on a great pace, and the nearer they approached the more they appeared, and at length they were likewiſe known to be Forces of the Souldans: This cauſed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and thoſe that were with him to make a ſtand, much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at this buſineſs, and not daring to go any further. They made up towards them a great pace and méeting with ſome of thoſe who fled, informed themſelves of the manner of the fight, and cauſed them to face about and return on their Enemies.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor ſéeing this was reſolvdd to receive them, but they ſtill made haſte, and arriving near the Emperors Forces, ſix Knights advancing forwards and couching their Lances, ran upon the Emperor and his Forces, and with the furiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Encounter they diſmounted five Knights that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49948:117"/>them, and the Emperor who was the ſixth, loſt both his Stirrops; they quickly paſſed on and ran furiouſly into their Enemies Squadrons, and ſhewed the admirableneſs of their valor by the mighty blows they gave, for in leſs than a quarter of an hour they had ſlain and diſmounted above a hundred Knights: and in this time their Forces by their example fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, and joyning with theie Enemies ſoon compelled them, in deſpight of the Emperor and the two Kings of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Georgia,</hi> to retire to the reſt of the Army. When they were all arrived there they gave a loud ſhout, and cryed out, <hi>Babylon, Babylon:</hi> This noiſe gave a freſh Alarm to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> wondring thereat, went to ſée the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, doubting that the Enemy had got more Aid: but he was ſoon ſatisfied of the contrary, for he knew the Common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers by their Colours: but he was much more aſtoniſhed when he ſaw the incomparable Déeds of the ſix valiant Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, and indéed they were all unknown to him, he coming nearer to them diſcovered one of them by his Armor to be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliano</hi> Prince of <hi>Phenicia,</hi> wherefore he went to him, and ſaid: Ah worthy Friend! great paines have you taken to come thus far to my aſſiſtance: the <hi>Phenician</hi> courteouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to him, Noble Prince, I ſhould not think it any trouble to travel throughout the whole world to ſerve you, eſpecially in ſo good company as I have brought with me; then he knowing that <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was willing to be informed who were in his company, told him that his Companions were his two vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Brothers, <hi>Don Glarineo</hi> and <hi>Don Lucidamore,</hi> and his Couſin <hi>Floriſpiano</hi> of <hi>Swevia,</hi> and the two other Knights were ſomewhat ſtrangers, but both valiant Knights; and ſo they were indéed, the one being the valiant <hi>Peter of Ireland, Knight of the Keys,</hi> and the other the <hi>Knight of the Wolf,</hi> and that they had brought from the Souldan of <hi>Babylon</hi> fifty thouſand men for his aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> being very joyful hereat ſoon entred the Fight, and was now again reſolved to conquer or die, and that this day ſhould put an end to the War: In this reſolution he went to his Companion the Prince of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and informed him
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49948:117"/>hereof, and telling him that he would with a Party of Horſe break through his Enemies Forces, and get betwéen them and the City and hinder their entrance, and that he would onely deſire him to proſecute the Fight, aſſuring him that there were ſuch valiant Knights come, that he queſtioned not to have the Victory.</p>
                     <p>Thus did he leave the <hi>Numidian</hi> and went to execute his purpoſe, and ſo he did, and ſoon brake through the Forces of the Enemy. The Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> being thus encouraged, drew up all his Forces and freſhly aſſailed his Enemies, and in ſhort time by the aſſiſtance of the ſix Champions, and the Forces they brought, he got ſo great advantage of his Enemies, that he forced them to retire; which they did not do ſo well but that many of them were ſlain. Among the reſt, <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> did gloriouſly; for he ſlew the <hi>Knight of Fame,</hi> Couſin to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and many Knights and Gyants that were near him. The two Princes <hi>Clarineo</hi> and <hi>Lucidamore</hi> took the King of <hi>Georgia</hi> Priſoner, maugre the reſiſtance of all his Guards, and the <hi>Knight of the Tyger</hi> hardly eſcaped with life, being very much wounded by <hi>Contumeliano</hi> Prince of <hi>Phenicia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> ſéeing that by the means of this freſh Supply he ſhould loſe the Day, reſolved to retire before he ſhould be quite vanquiſhed, wherefore he cauſed a Retreat to be ſounded, and ſo retired to enter the City, but <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> who expected him, hindred him there-from and fiercely aſſaulted him: greatly ſurprized was the Emperor when he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſſaulted on both ſides, wherefore he advanced forwards to ſée who it was that hindered his Retreat; but he was ſo bravely received by his Rival, that notwithſtanding his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavors he could not get off; but after he had received many wounds by <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> was taken Priſoner: the reſt of his Forces in the mean time ſéeing the Field loſt, left him and fled in great diſorder into the City.</p>
                     <p>Great was the ſorrow in the City for the loſs of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, they not yet knowing whether he were alive or dead, none of the Commanders returned back but the King of <hi>Albania:</hi> the King of <hi>Georgia</hi> being taken, and the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> being
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49948:118"/>killed, the <hi>Knight of the Tyger</hi> was brought in wounded, and thus the Night being come the horror of the day was covered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſéeing the Emperors Forces were got into the City, cauſed a Retreat to be ſounded, and ſo repaired to his Tent, which was ſet up near the City Walls, and the prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> being come to him, they delivered the two Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, the Emperor and the King of <hi>Georgia,</hi> into ſafe cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy under a ſtrong Guard, commanded by the <hi>Knight of Hope,</hi> and then they ſent for all thoſe valiant Knights who had aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. They quickly came to the Tent, where they were kindly embraced by the two Generals, the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> being very joyful to ſée his Friend <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> his two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who had diſcovered themſelves: they were on all ſides joyful for this happy méeting, and much more in that it had béen ſo fortunate.</p>
                     <p>The Prince <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> delivered two Letters to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one from the Souldan, and another from his Daughter the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella.

                     <p>Having thus finiſhed her Lamentation, ſhe with extream grief fell down to the ground; but bethinking her ſelf that ſhe was a Chriſtian, and therefore was bound to preſerve her life ſo long as ſhe could, ſhe aroſe and ſought about for a place at preſent to ly down more conveniently to repoſe her ſelf till the morning: after ſome travel ſhe found a place near the water ſide that was ſomewhat commodious for that purpoſe, being encompaſſed with great Réeds, where ſhe laid her ſelf down expecting the morning; which being come, ſhe not having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any reſt, aroſe; and not knowing what to do, nor whither to go, being in a great Wood, at length with much difficulty climbed up a Trée, and being come to the top looked about her, to ſée if ſhe could diſcover any Houſes or People: At length ſhe ſaw ſome People afar off walking, being glad of that, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the Trée and went forwards to that place, which was a Common Road; and ſéeing people coming ſhe retired into the Wood a little way, to conſider with her ſelf what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49948:120"/>to be done. Then ſhe reſolved not to go home to her Father, but rather to travel towards <hi>Ireland</hi> the Countrey of her dearly beloved Knight, believing that if he eſcaped with life he would go thither, and thither ſhe intended to go and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him: but the habit ſhe was in being very gorgeous and coſtly, ſhe knew that it would be very inconvenient to travel in, and therefore ſhe reſolved with the firſt conveniency to alter her Apparel: ſhe quickly had the opportunity of putting this her reſolution into execution; for the next woman that went by was a Pilgrim, to whom ſhe went, and deſiring her to come a little out of the way they retired into the Wood, where the Princeſs told her that ſhe had a requeſt to make to her, which ſhe deſired her to grant, and that it could not be in the leaſt to her prejudice.</p>
                     <p>The good woman ſéeing her in ſo rich Apparel, thought that it would be ill manners in her to deny her any thing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe conſented to her Requeſt: Then the Princeſs told her that ſhe deſired her to exchange her Apparel with her. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at firſt was unwilling, but at length ſhe conſented, and ſo changing their Habits, the Princeſs likewiſe gave her ſome money, and ſo they parted.</p>
                     <p>The Princeſs being thus accoutred, deſired to know the way to the next Port Town, to which ſhe travelled, and being come thither, ſhe deſired to embarque her ſelf: and enquiring for ſhipping ſhe found one going for <hi>England,</hi> into which ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued her ſelf, reſolving never to return to her Father, but ſtill to travel in ſearch of her Knight.</p>
                     <p>The Ship in ſhort time arrived at <hi>England,</hi> and there ſhe was expoſed to a new travel through that Countrey, and then taking ſhipping again ſhe went for <hi>Ireland,</hi> where when ſhe arrived ſhe travelled towards <hi>Wexford,</hi> the place of her dear Knights Nativity: At length ſhe arrived there, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the Earl his Father, found him and all his Family in much diſcontent for the abſence of his Son.</p>
                     <p>Thus being arrived here, and reſolving to abide in this place, ſhe cauſed Workmen to build a ſmall Monaſtery with the Money ſhe brought from her Fathers Court, and when it was
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49948:121"/>builded ſhe Dedicated it to the Honor of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the Holy Apoſtle, in memory of her dear Knight.</p>
                     <p>In this place ſhe encloſed her ſelf, reſolving to live a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life all her days in expectation of the return of her dearly beloved Knight.

                     <p>THus continued theſe Perſonages, the Earl and his Wife, and the Holy <hi>Magdalena,</hi> in continual care and fear, but they were all continually in hopes one day to hear of the ſafe Return of their Son and Friend: but they were much perplexed at an Adventure that hapned one day, which was in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Certain Fiſher-men having béen abroad at Sea a fiſhing, amongſt other Fiſhes which they caught one hapned to be a very fair <hi>Sturgeon,</hi> at which they wondred, and at their return to <hi>Wexford</hi> they went to the Earl, and preſented the Fiſh as a great Novelty to him: the which be thankfully received, and ſhewing the ſame to his Counteſs, ſhe cauſed it immediately to be cut in pieces: But oh ſtrange Accident! in the Belly of this Fiſh ſhe diſcouered ſomewhat that was red, which having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49948:121"/>out, they found it to be a red Purſe of Cloth, and having opened the ſame there was in it thrée Iewels, which ſhe earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beholding, knew to be the ſame ſhe had delivered to her Son <hi>Peter</hi> at ſuch time as he departed from her, when he firſt began his Travels.</p>
                     <p>This ſight gave her great aſtoniſhment, and ſhe going im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Earl her Husband ſhewed them to him, and he knowing them was as much troubled, and then they certainly concluded and ſaw that all their hopes of the Return of their Son <hi>Peter</hi> was in vain; for they verily believed that he had béen eaſt away at Sea, and the Fiſhes had devoured him: and in this opinion they remained, making great Lamentations for the loſs of him, never more expecting to ſée him. Then they immediately put themſelves and all their Family into Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Apparel, and hung all their Houſe in Mourning, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red every thing as if he had béen certainly dead, and they had ſéen him buried, ſo confident were they of the truth of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. And thus continued they in geeat and private mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for many days, being ſéen of none but their own Family. So ſoon as the Counteſs went abroad, ſhe went to the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to viſit the Holy <hi>Magdalena,</hi> where when ſhe was arrived ſhe expreſſed by her outward looks and habit, the inward ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of her minde.</p>
                     <p>The Holy Maid being deſirous to know the occaſion of this, believing it to be ſome extraordinary matter, deſired the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs to inform her of the cauſe of her immoderate ſorrow, the which ſhe did with many tears, and the Holy Maid accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied her in her tears, verily believing this to be true, and that now ſhe ſhould never more ſée her dear Knight <hi>Peter.</hi> The Counteſs ſuppoſing that ſhe ſhed thoſe tears out of affection to her loſs, thinking to be conſolated by her, was forced her ſelf to give her ſome conſolation, ſo great was her grief, but ſhe little thought that the Holy Maid was ſo déeply concerned in this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>After many lamentations and tears, the Counteſs deſired the Holy Maid that ſhe would come and viſit her oftener, that they might lament together, and ſo ſhe departed, leaving the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49948:122"/>fair <hi>Magdalena</hi> in the greateſt grief in the world. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs being gone, ſhe retired her ſelf into her Chamber, where throwing her ſelf upon her Bed, ſhe thus began: Ah unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Maid, how far better had it béen that thou hadſt never béen born, than thou ſhouldſt be the occaſion of ſo much grief: I was the cauſe that the good Knight <hi>Peter</hi> adventured himſelf in ſuch manner, that he has now loſt his life; and therefore it is my cauſe that ſo much grief is come to his Parents for his loſs. Certainly he looſing of me, hath travelled ſo many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys in ſearching for me, that he is now caſt away at Sea and become food for Fiſhes. It had béen much better that I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver béen fair, or at leaſt that I had never conſented to have left my Parents, ſo to torment and afflict them; but Heaven is juſt and hath now deſervedly ſent this loſs to puniſh mefor my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience: Ah what ſhall now become of me? I ſhall never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſée the fare of my dear Knight, nor never give any comfort to my dear Parents in my ſight, for (ſince I have béen ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate) here will I end my life, and for the future do better ſervice to God for the expiation of my ſins.</p>
                     <p>Thus did ſhe lament, and thus continued ſhe in this place in the greateſt devotion in the world, never ſtirring out but to the Earls, where ſhe went ſometimes, to accompany them in their Lamentations for the loſs of their Son and her Friend, reſolving that ſo long as ſhe lived ſhe would not diſcover her Quality and Condition to any one: and in this place we muſt for ſome time leave her, and return to her dearly beloved <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Princes and Knights who were in their way to <hi>Babylon:</hi> but we will firſt by the way tell you the News that came to <hi>Babylon</hi> to the Souldan and the fair Princeſs <hi>Florisbella.</hi>

The Princeſſes <hi>Florisbella</hi> and <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taroſa</hi> were greatly ſatisfied at the Arrival of the Knights, and did both believe that in ſhort time they ſhould have the company of their Knights; and therefore the Princeſs <hi>Floris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> endeavored to put her Affairs into ſuch order, that <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> at his return might give her and himſelf the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſhe deſired, wherefore ſhe taking an opportunity when onely her ſelf, and Mother, and her Couſin the Princeſs <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taroſa</hi> were together, ſhe began to her Mother thus:</p>
                     <p>Madam, good fortune have we had, that the Gods have at ſo neceſſary a time as this, ſent us ſo valiant Knights to defend our Empire when it was moſt in danger: but withal I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſorry and diſcontented that my perſon ſhould give ſo great on occaſion, as to endanger the lives of ſuch valiant Knights, and I would to the Gods that we could invent ſome way to prevent this trouble for the future.</p>
                     <p>The Empreſs replied, I queſtion not Daughter, but what Forces are already goue (with the aſſiſtance of the Gods, a juſt Cauſe, and the Aid of ſo many brave Princes and Knights) will be able without any more trouble to bring home Victory, or at leaſt to force the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> to ſuch a Peace as ſhall be as diſadvantagious to him, as he intended to us: but there is ſomething elſe further to be conſidered of, for ſo
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49948:123"/>long as you remain unmarried, you being the onely Heir of this Empire, we ſhall be in the like danger, either the love or ambition of ſome Perſons will readily promyt them to give us a trouble; therefore dear Daughter, ſince your years of childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood are paſt, and you are capable of making a Choice, it would be neceſſary and convenient for you, amongſt ſo many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great Perſonages that ſue for your favor, that you would chooſe one whom you think fit to make your Husband, that thereby all the reſt may be ſatisfied, and we left quiet, and that your Father and I in our old age may live without this trouble.</p>
                     <p>Madam, replyed the Princeſs, if either you or my Father would propound ſome one that were fitting for my Quality and Condition, I ſhould be ready to bend my inclinations towards him, and willingly content you therein.</p>
                     <p>Madam, ſaid the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> I ſuppoſe the Princeſs my Couſin would willingly ſatisfie your ſelf and her Father in this particular: but if you pleaſe to hear my advice, I ſhall endeavor to pleaſe you both. I believe it the moſt neceſſary thing to be conſidered of in this Choice, to have one that ſhall be both valiant and able to defend this Countrey from all its Enemies: theſe Wars have teſtified that you have Enemies, and therefore it is neceſſary as well to prevent a future danger as to end this: there are ſeveral brave Princes and Knights engaged in this war, and out of the ſame one might be thought of, that might be a fit Match, and if I may with fréedom ſpeak I ſhall name the Perſon.</p>
                     <p>The Empereſs who had heard her Couſin, liked well of her counſel, and therefore told her that ſhe ſhould willingly not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear her, but alſo give her conſent thereto, provided it were ſuch a perſon as was every way both by Deſcent and Valor, deſerving, and if her Daughters good will and inclination were added thereto.</p>
                     <p>The Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> (very well knowing that ſhe ſhould give no diſtaſte to her Couſin in precéeding) replied, That the perſon whom ſhe thought moſt fit for a Husband for her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin was the moſt accompliſhed Perſon for Valor, Vertue, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49948:123"/>Princely Deſcent in the whole world, and the perſon that that Empire and they all were moſt obliged to: and, ſaith ſhe, I ſhall not néed to name him further, for this Character does ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently teſtifie that it can be none other but the Prince <hi>Don Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anis</hi> of <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Empereſs replyed, That truly ſhe always had a very great eſtéem for that Prince, and ſhe ſuppoſed that gratitude had cauſed ſome inclination in her Daughters minde; and ſays ſhe, I am ſure that he has deſerved more of him than all men living: and could I ſinde that ſhe would be willing to accept of him, I would not onely give my own conſent to the Match, but I would endeavor to perſwade the Souldan my Husband thereto, and I queſtion not but the many Services which that good Prince hath done him, will engage him to give him that ſatisfaction, if he deſires it.</p>
                     <p>As for that Madam, ſaid <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> I am ſure that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Prince <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> is extreamly amorous of my Couſin <hi>Florisbella,</hi> and that it hath béen the ſole cauſe of his coming hither, which hath béen ſo much for the advantage of us all, he himſelf told me this, and I think my ſelf not onely obliged to tell you, but to do what elſe for him I can.</p>
                     <p>The Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> ſéeing things brought to this paſs, thus anſwered them, Dear Mother, ſince it is your pleaſure for me to ſpeak in this occaſion, I ſhall do it with all fréedom, and therefore aſſure your ſelf that ever ſince I firſt ſaw the Prince <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> I have had a very great inclination for him, but I have ſmothered it till now I hear he is a Perſon not only fit by his worth and deſert, but your eſtéem of him to be ſo, and therefore if you and my Father ſhould be ſo contented, I ſhall think my ſelf happy in having a perſon ſo every way accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed for my Husband, and I queſtion not but his worth will ſufficiently plead for him to my Father.</p>
                     <p>The Empereſs being highly ſatisfied in the Anſwer of her Daughter, ſaid that ſhe would immediately take ſuch Orders with the Souldan, as ſhe would not onely know his mind here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but alſo if occaſion be, perſwade him thereto to the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all, and ſo ſhe departed from her Couſin and Daughter,

                           <p>Since my laſt to you, our Succeſs in your Wars hath been very various, for the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> continuing in his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, endeavored all he could to lengthen the War, which he effected by the continual arrival of freſh Forces: but however the Juſtice of your Cauſe gave us ſufficient Succeſs; for alrhough your Forces did rather diminiſh than encreaſe, yet we ſtill joyned the better: At length we being wearied with the tediouſneſs of the War, reſolved though to our diſadvantage, to hazard all in one Battel which we both began and continued with equal ſucceſs till new Forces arriving at his Army ſomewhat diſcouraged your Soldiers; but however I reſolved to put an end to the War with that one days Battel, if poſſible, and therefore giving your Forces freſh encouragement, by my endeavours we continued the Fight; but moſt fortunate was it for us that thoſe Forces you ſent under the Conduct of my Brothers and Friends, came at that time ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely, for it ſo diſcouraged our Enemies, and gave ſo much encouragement to your Soldiers, that all reſolved to make this uſe thereof, either to conquer or die. This their Reſolution they well enough performed, for after a long and bloody Battel, our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49948:124"/>were forced out of the Field (which they had before kept) into the City, to their great loſs: not onely the Common Soldiers and many brave Knights ſuffered and loſt their lives, but the Chief Commanders alſo. The Emperor it was my fortune to take Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and the King of <hi>Georgia</hi> who had aſſiſted him with fifty thouſand men, was taken by my two Brethren, and the reſt put to flight, ſo that we may conclude the War to be at an end.

I beg an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for my not giving you a particular account of our Battel and Victory, doubting the tediouſneſs thereof would diſpleaſe you.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſt Mighty Prince, We have great Cauſe to be thankful to the Gods for the Mercy they have ſhewed us, in ſending you into this Countrey at a time when we were in ſo great diſtreſs; for without your preſence we had all e're this time bin in ſo great a ſtrait, that our fortunes, nay our very lives had been in very great hazard: there is none of us here but if he enjoys Wife, Children, or Eſtate, or Liberty, is obliged to you for the protection thereof, ſo that this whole Empire is of right belonging to you, it having been ſo marvellouſly protected, and miraculouſly defended by your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Valor. Therefore moſt noble Prince, as all We have or enjoy is abſolutely your Right to poſſeſs, ſo let us know what, or how We ſhall make you ſome ſatisfaction: As for our own part, Our Self, Our Empreſs, and Our Daughter, ſhall be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at your diſpoſe, and we ſhall all joyfully obey your juſt Deſires or Commands, knowing that the Gods who have endowed you with ſo much Valor, have certainly beſtowed on you the like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Vertue; and therefore moſt Noble Prince, I beſeech you let us know your deſires, and they ſhall be abſolutely performed and obeyed.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſt redoubted Souldan, I am very ſorry that I ſhould give your Highneſs ſo much trouble, as to come thus far to meet your poor Servants, but much more diſcontented and aſhamed that you ſhould here before this Noble Company heap ſo many commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49948:126"/>on me who have acted the leaſt of all this Company: but if I had done any thing worthy of note, it is no more than I am bound by the Order of Knighthood, and the Bonds of Civility and true Vertue to do; for what I have done bath been to relieve the oppreſſed, and nothing but Juſtice; with which Actions the Heavens are pleaſed we ſhould exerciſe our ſelves, and for that end are we created, one bare acknowledgment is a ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe: but what I have performed has been by vertue of the Commands of that Incomparable Princeſs your Daughter, who hath made me ſo happy as to admit me to be her Servant, and in whoſe juſt quarrel I ſhall dare to do any thing that ſhe ſhall further command me, not queſtioning but her goodneſs will give me a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſufficient: and if you pleaſe to let me continue her Servant, and give me freedom in that, I ſhall eſteem my ſelf in the greateſt height of happineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this the Souldan replied, <hi>Prince of <hi>Greece,</hi> I am ſo far ſatisfied in my Daughters minde, that ſhe has not onely a great eſteem of your Vertues, but alſo an affection for your Perſon, and if you are pleaſed with her, and think the enjoyment of her Perſon will be any recompence for your great Labors, be confident that you may have a free poſſeſſion thereof, and we ſhal think our ſelves happy that we can have ſo brave a Prince for our Son in Law, by whoſe power and magnanimity we queſtion not but we ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend this Empire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> having heard this, immediately fell on his knées, and notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance of the Souldan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> kiſſed his hand, and ſtraitly embracing him, in moſt humble manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ah Mighty Sir! What Thanks or Rerurns am I able to make for this ſo immenſe and moſt deſirable Favour? were I poſſeſſed of the whole Worlds Empire, I ſhould yet eſteem my ſelf too mean a perſon to enjoy ſo great a happineſs as that of the Perſon of your moſt Incomparable Daughter, whoſe rare Perfections command all the Potentates in the whole World to be at her diſpoſe: And
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49948:127"/>Sir, aſſure your ſelf, that for the future it ſhall be my endeavors to conquer Kingdoms, and vanquiſh-Kings, that I may lay their Crowns at her feet, as a juſt Tribute to her Vertues.</hi>

                     <p>Having thus ſpoken, he aroſe from the ground, and retiring back a few ſteps, he permitted his Brothers and Companions to go forwards and be received by the Souldan, and then he himſelf went forwards and kindly ſaluted the Nobility of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Thus having done they all remounted their Horſes, and in good order marched towards <hi>Babylon,</hi> but it grew ſo late that the Souldan reſolved not to enter the City that night but to ſtay at a Pallace of his a league from the City: at which place they being arrived, took up their Quarters for that night and prepared for their entrance into the City the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which being come, they all again mounted their horſes and ſet forwards. This day the Prince <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and the Souldan rode on together, and then his two Brethren, and ſo the reſt of the Princes and Knights in order: When they came near the City, the Magiſtrates thereof came and preſented themſelves in their richeſt Habiliment, and made a Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulory Oration to <hi>Don Bellianis:</hi> and ſo all the way that they rode he had ſeveral Orations and Preſents made him; for which he gave them many thanks.</p>
                     <p>The two Priſoners, the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> and the King of <hi>Georgia,</hi> came in the midſt of the Army, being placed in two Chariots with Chains and Ferters of Gold, and a great Guard about them, and thus did arrive at the Pallace, where they were met by the Empereſs and her Ladias. The Princes and Knights ſoon left their horſes, and on foot advanced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, where <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> falling on his knées was kindly and lovingly embraced by the Empereſs; but when he came before the preſence of his Princeſs he knéeled on the ground, not daring to caſt one glance of his eyes upon her divine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. She was this day dreſſed in a Gown of Sky-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sattin embroidered with Gold, and richly beſet with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and Rubies, repreſeneing Stars in the Heavens, but her Face appeared to be more glorious that the Sun when he is in his greateſt luſtre: her Boſom fitly repreſented the Milky
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49948:127"/>whey, and in all her parts there was ſo much excellency and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, that it dazléd the eyes of the Beholders. Our poor Prince was all this while on the ground, not daring either to look up or ſpeak: but having her by one of her hands more white than the driven Snow, he moſt amorouſly kiſſed that, and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many ſighs, bathed it in tears. She well knowing that he was ſurprized, ſaid to him, What, moſt Noble Prince, after having conquered many enemies, have you not confidence to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a Lady your Friend? He then recovering himſelf, and looking on her Face, ſaid: Dear Princeſs, ſo much tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent light procéeds from your divine Countenance, that I am not holy enough to look up, leſt for my preſumption I be ſtruck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en blinde. But conſidering with himſelf that he was obſerved by many in that paſſion, he again ſaluting her hand aroſe, and making an obeyſance paſſed on towards the Princeſs <hi>Mattaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> who kindly received him: and ſo the reſt of the Knights ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving performed their duties to the Ladies, he went to his Princeſs, and ſéeing the Souldan was leading the Empereſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may, he likewiſe took the Princeſs by the hand and went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them: after he was come into the great Hall they diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, and a coſtly banquet being prepared they all ſate down; which being done, the Souldan did then declare to his Empereſs and Daughter what he had promiſed to <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> wherewith they were ſo well ſatisfied, that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded forthwith to have them married; and therefore not onely cauſed all thoſe Princes that were there preſent to continue in the Court till the Ceremony ſhould be performed, but he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſent into all the adjacent.

No ſooner were they all ſeated, but ſilence was commanded, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſound of twelve Trumpets, Protlamation was made that all ſuch Knights as were there preſent, orſhould during the tearm of the Tournament arrive, ſhould have frée liberty of ſhewing their utmoſt endeavors in the Acts of Chivalry both at the Sword and Lance, provided they did conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſuch Orders as were appointed, or ſhould be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either by the Souldan or <hi>Don Bellianis.</hi> And it was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proclaimed, that the Tournament ſhould continue for four days.</p>
                     <p>The firſt day <hi>Contumeliano</hi> Prince of <hi>Phenicia</hi> had leave with fifty Knights to maintain and kéep the Field in Honor of the new Married Pair, againſt all Opponents.

                     </p>
                     <p>Soon after this Proclamation was made, the Prince <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliano</hi> entred the Field accompanied with fifty Knights, and after he had done his uſual Reverence to the Souldan, and

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd made his Reverence, he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced forwards to the other end, and there prepared himſelf for a Courſe againſt <hi>Don Contumeliano;</hi> which <hi>Contumeliano</hi> ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared himſelf to receive him, and ſo accordingly they ran againſt one another with ſuch force, that their Lances flew into the Air all broken into ſhivers without any other diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but that of the <hi>Knight of the Bear</hi> looſing his Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops, which he ſoon recovered, and by ſuch time as he came to the end of his Courſe, he had reſetled himſelf on his Horſe in as good a manner as he was at the firſt.</p>
                     <p>This equality in our Champions raiſed a new vigor in them, and taking freſh Lances they again eſſayed which ſhould have the better: and not onely they themſelves ran the ſecond time, but alſo twenty of each of their Knights; but this Courſe was much to the diſadvantage of the <hi>Knight of the Bear</hi> and his Companions; for he was thrown out of his Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and with him twelve of his Company, and onely ſix of the Prince <hi>Contumeliano's</hi> Knighis were foiled, and himſelf was forced to lay hold on his Horſe neek.</p>
                     <p>This Courſe raiſed an anger in both the Champions, which made them and their Companions quickly remount their h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and then it was agréed on, that at the third Courſe they and their whole Squadrons, which was eaſily divided into fifty in a Squadron, ſhould again run with their Lances, and after that try their fortunes with their Swords. Which A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréement was quickly put in execution, and they accordingly ran againſt one another with indifferent equality of fortune; for there was about twenty of a party thrown to the ground, but they quickly poſſeſſed themſelves of their horſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting drew their Swords, and began a brave Skirmiſh, to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49948:129"/>the great delight of the Beholders, many of them being beaten from their horſes by the mighty and puiſſant ſtrokes which they gave and received each unto other. But there was this Proviſion made before the Iouſts, that none ſhould enter the Fields whoſe Swords were ſharp, but onely whoſe Swords were dnd'd on the edge, to the end that none ſhould be killed, and that the Recreation of ſome might not be the deſtruction of others; however many of the Knights on both ſides were with the violence of the ſtrokes beaten from their horſes, and much bruiſed with the falls, and the trampling of the horſes killed ſome out-right.</p>
                     <p>Thus this Skirmiſhing continued the ſpace of four hours, but in the end the Honor of the Day was won by the Prince of <hi>Phenicia,</hi> the <hi>Knight of the Bear</hi> by a fall which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, being diſabled from ſitting his horſe, and being carried out of the Field by ſeveral of his Knights was conveyed to his Lodgings: And then Proclamation was made, That that days Tournament ſhould end, and ſo they all departed the Field and went to the Pallace, where they were no ſooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived and ſeated in their places, but at the ſound of Muſick many of them began to dance.</p>
                     <p>In this and ſuch like variety of Recreation they continued for ſome hours, till it was time for every one to take their reſt, and then our pair of Incomparable Lovers retired into their Lodgings, went to Bed and received the Enjoyment which they had ſo long wiſhed for, and was now accompliſhed, to the great Ioy not onely of the two Lovers, but of all their Friends and Relations: In which Content we will leave them till morning, which being come they all aroſe, and the fair Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> by the crimſon Dy which appeared in her love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chéeks, did well enough expreſs that ſhe had exchanged her Maiden-head for that of a Wife: and the Prince of <hi>Greece</hi> by his outward geſtures did ſufficiently teſtifie the ſatisfaction of his ſpirit in the enjoyment of his Incomparable Lady.</p>
                     <p>Noon being come and Dinner ended, they did all repair a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the plate appointed for the Tournament, where the Valiant <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> with fifty Knights did bear away the Honor of that Day.</p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:49948:130"/>
                     <p>Thus were thrée of the four days ſpent in Iuſting, Tilting, Tournaments, Skirmiſhing, and dancing, and all other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of delightful Exerciſes: And the fourth day was now come and Dinner being ended, and every one ſeated in their ſeveral places, the Valiant Prince <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> (who as you have heard was to maintain the Field for that day) was entred the Liſts at the head of fifty valiant Knights, when after the accuſtomed Civilities done to the Souldan and Ladies, he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf ready for the Iouſt, when preſently entred a Knight in black Armor, having the Figure of <hi>Envy</hi> painted on his Shield. This Knight coming in a time of Mirth in ſuch an unaccuſtomed manner, cauſed great Admiration in all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders: but the Actions which he did gave them greater cauſe of anger, for no ſooner had he placed himſelf at one end of the Liſts in the head of all his Knights, but he ran with great violence againſt the Prince <hi>Clarineo,</hi> intending to kill him with his Lance, for which purpoſe his Lance had a long Spike of Stéel at the end, and was made of the ſtrongeſt wood; but he miſſed of his aim, for he onely ran the Prince through the left arm, and there brake his Lance. All his Companions did run with the like violence, and intended the like miſchief, but ſome of them were thrown from their horſes: but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus armed, did much miſchief to ſeveral of the Princes Knights, killing fiftéen out right.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his Relations were extremly angred here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, who were all unarmed, or at the beſt had onely blunt Swords according to the Agréement of the Tournament, but extream great was the Cry, Noiſe, and Confuſion of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and Ladies, fearing leſt they ſhould have béen all deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this unfortunate Skirmiſh. This raiſed the anger of our <hi>Grecian</hi> Prince to ſuch a height, that he was ready even to run amongſt the throng, unarmed as he was, when ſuddenly he ſaw another Troop of above one hundred and fifty Knights enter the Field, who ſoon teſtified to whom they did belong by the ſtrokes which they gave; for at eveey ſtroke blood followed their Swords, ſo that he ſoon knew thein to be his Enemies: which he ſéeing, and being now ſo far come to himſelf as to conſider
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49948:130"/>the danger, he cauſed all the Ladies to depart, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all his Friends, ran haſtily to their ſeveral Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to arm themſelves; which they did in the beſt manner they could, and returning to the Field they found that above five hundred of his Friends and Knights were either ſlain or wounded. He ſoon made head againſt his Enemies, and aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them with a great deal of rage and anger, to the great help of his friends, and to the loſs and diſcouragement of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Many were on both ſides ſlain by the hands of <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis</hi> and his Enemy, the <hi>Knight of Envy,</hi> who now met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and began a furious Fight, to the great amazement of all the Beholders. They were both greatly wounded and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at each others ſtrength, when in the midſt of their fury there appeared over their heads a great Cloud: which breaking there was ſéen &amp; heard great Thunder and Lightning, which amazed all in the place, and a great Darkneſs was over all the place for the ſpace of a quarter of an hour: at the end of which there appeared a ſmall Caſtle in the place of the Combat, and by it lay <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> along on the earth, and many of his Friends: There alſo appeared an ancient woman who taking a Bottle, put it to the mouth of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> and ſome of the Water that was in it paſſing into his Body he revived and aroſe, and looking about him ſaw that which was hapned, and ſaw the old Woman, and knew her to be <hi>Bellona</hi> the Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs, who deſired him to go about the Field, and pull off the Helmets from the heads of thoſe Knights that lay there, that ſhe might aſſiſt his Friends; which he did accordingly, and there they found his two Brothers <hi>Clarineo</hi> and <hi>Lucidamore, Contumeliano,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with many others much wounded: to whom ſhe gave ſome of her Water, and they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently aroſe in very good eſtate and condition, much wondring at that which had hapned. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſéeing this, did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that all that had happened this day had béen bone by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, and therefore he asked <hi>Bellona</hi> who and what theſe Enemies were? and whether they were real men, or onely Enchantment?</p>
                     <p>To which ſhe replyed, That in general they were men, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49948:131"/>valiant Knights, as he and his Companions could well enough reſtifie, that they were his Enemies, and came to diſturb the peace he was in: and that they might not for the future be in a capacity to injure him further, ſhe had provided that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle which ſhe ſhewed him, and thereinto ſhe ſaid it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary they ſhould be put: in order to which they all went about the Field, and as many of the Knights their Enemies which were about fifty, as they could finde yet alive, were preſently put into that Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>This being done, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his Brethren, Friends, and Knights, in the Company of the ſage <hi>Bellona,</hi> ſet forwards towards the Pallace: being met by the Souldan, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, and Princeſſes. Being all ſeated, the Sage <hi>Bellona</hi> ſpake to them thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſt Noble Souldan and Empereſs, and you other Kings, Queens, Princes and Princeſſes, Knights and Ladies, It is many years ſince I foreknew the misfortune that would this day happen unto you, and many days and nights have I ſpent in conſidering of a way to prevent this miſchief, but I could not find a better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient than what I have now executed. You are all now in good health, and the ill that was intended is now prevented, ſo that you may aſſure your ſelves that you are out of all danger of any preſent harm. What they are that thus diſturbed you, you need not care to know at this time, for they are ſafe enough from doing you any further miſchief; wherefore proceed now in your Mirth, ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whatſoever ſhall be able to diſturb you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She having ſpoken thus held her peace, and the Souldan and the reſt gave great thanks to <hi>Bellona</hi> for the Service ſhe had done them. Thus Reader we will make an end of this Part of this Hiſtory, leaving our Princes in great quiet, and in the Third Part we ſhall tell you who were the <hi>Knight of Envy</hi> and his Companions, and the cauſe of their coming at this time; As alſo an end of the Wars betwéen the two Empires of <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bizond</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> and what became of the two Princes <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aneo</hi> and <hi>Gramalis</hi> of <hi>Thrace</hi> in the Pleaſant Iſland, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my other pleaſant and delightful Adventures.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49948:134"/>he wore about his arm; and in this equipage accompanied with fifty Knights, all in the ſame coloured Armor, he entred the Liſts, and expected his Aſſaylants; and now, it being the laſt day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Solemnity of the Wedding, all the young Knights of the Court reſolved to try their Fortunes, intending to gain Honour; but although ſeveral of them performed very well, yet he kept the Field to the laſt, and clearly bore away the Honour of that days Triumph, to the great ſatiſfaction of the whole Court; but chiefly to the great pleaſure of his Princeſs.</p>
                     <p>And now the Triumphs being ended, and all the Court ready to riſe and leave their ſeats, a great voice of Trumpets was heard, at which every one wondring, looked towards the place from whence they ſuppoſed the noiſe came; but behold there was nothing but a great cloud, which being in ſome ſhort time va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, they ſaw the Caſtle where the Knight of <hi>Envy</hi> was; and at the four corners of this Caſtle were placed four Trumpeters, who ſtill continued ſounding their Trumpets: alſo at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Caſtle there were two Giants armed at all points, with Iron Maces in their hands, and broad cutting Faulchions by their ſides; and ſix foot on this ſide the Giants, there was a Pillar of Iaſper, and on it hung a Table, whereon was written this Propheſie.</p>

                     <p>Theſe were the words written on the Table; which when <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> had read, the Trumpeters ceaſed to ſound their Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets; and he went back to his Father and Princeſs, to acquaint them with what he knew of this Adventure.

                     <p>And now this Adventure of the inchanted Caſtle being proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted as much as was convenient, and all the Triumphs of this magnificent Wedding being ended, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> did propoſe to the Souldan, his Father in Law, the finiſhing the War with the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond,</hi> and offered his ſervice to go in perſon about it; but the Souldan would not by any means conſent to that: neither would the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> hear of any ſuch propoſition, telling him, that ſhe had rather loſe ten ſuch Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, then permit him to take ſo long a journey, eſpecially in ſo hazardous and troubleſome a War; wherefore another way was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49948:135"/>propoſed; which was, that the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond,</hi> who was then in priſon, ſhould bé treated with, to ſée if he would grant that willingly, which it was impoſſible for him to hinder; and thereupon Meſſengers were ſent to treat with him, who had fair propoſitions to offer; for they alledging, and that with truth enough, that the Emperor was the only cauſe of the War, it was therefore but juſt and fit, that he ſhould pay all the dammage and expence of the ſame; and if he would do ſo, or leave the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan in quiet and peaceable poſſeſſion of that part of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which he had already conquered, then he ſhould not only have a peace, but be reſtored to his liberty. Theſe were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions that were made to the Emperor; who as low as he was in his preſent miſfortunes, yet he was high in his own opinion, and ſo in his reply; for having loſt that which he chiefly aimed at, the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> he was ſo inraged, that he cared not what he did; but replied, that his pretenſions to the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> being the effects of his love, he thought they were but juſt, and therefore he could not be juſtly taxed with being the only cauſe of the War; for if the Princeſs had béen granted to him, the War would have ended; but ſince it was ſo, that the Princeſs was otherwiſe diſpoſed of, and thereby he was fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his expectations, he thought it was but juſt, that he ſhould be reſtored to his liberty, and his Empire reſtored to him: but he thus eloſed, that if this would not be granted, he queſtioned not but that he had ſo many loyal Subjects in his own Dominions, and ſo many Friends and Allies abroad, that he ſhould gain that by force which was denied him. This was the anſwer of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, which was judged to be ſo unreaſonable, that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on all hands, that the War ſhould be vigorouſly proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; and to that end Letters were preſently ſent away to <hi>Don Baltazano,</hi> to know of him the condition of the Army under his command, and in what condition the Enemies were; that they might from thence conclude what Forces were neceſſary to be raiſed. A Meſſenger being diſpatched to <hi>Don Baltazano,</hi> who was left with an hundred thouſand men at the ſiege of the City of <hi>Phatez,</hi> which was fortified, and defended againſt him by the King of <hi>Albania,</hi> and the Knight of the <hi>Tyger,</hi> as is before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: This Meſſenger was not long before he returned to the Souldan, and brought this Letter.</p>

She had divided her Forces in thrée Battalias; one, which was the Van, ſhe led her ſelf, and under her command were forty thouſand men; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which was the Body of the Army, was commanded by the King of <hi>Albania,</hi> and he had under him ſixty thouſand men; and the Rear was led by the Lieutenant General of the King of <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> who was a very valiant Knight, and known by the name of the Knight of the <hi>Lions,</hi> who alſo had forty thouſand men: and the like number of forty thouſand men was left in the City, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of the valiant Knight of the <hi>Tyger.</hi> Thus was ſhe accompanied, but her Armor and Accoutrements were extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; for ſhe rode on an excellent Horſe, who was covered with white Armor; and her own was gréenena melled with Gold, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet out with precious Stones; ſhe had a Lance is her hand, and a good Sword by her ſide, which b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Forces which he led were ſomewhat leſs then hers, but they were modelized in the ſame manner, being divided into thrée Squadrons, led by thrée truſty and valiant Knights; he himſelf took no particular command, as thinking it to be more convenient to be frée, that he might be every where, as occaſion ſerved; only he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, and he alſo had left twenty thouſand men in his Camp, to guard that,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49948:138"/>and to be as a reſerve to the reſt of his Army, as occaſion ſhould require. In this order, and thus prepared, did theſe two valiant Generals march at the head of their Armies, and, ſlowly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing before their Forces, at length met. The firſt that encountred were the two Generals, the brave <hi>Numidian,</hi> and the gallant <hi>Floreza;</hi> who putting the Lance to her Reſt failed not to encounter him, and that with ſuch violence, hitting him on the Shield which he held out to receive her, that he was ſo ſhaken with the blow, that he was forced to catch hold of his Horſes neck, to kéep him from falling. He had never met with the like force in any man before, wherefore he was mightily aſtoniſhed; but he being reſolved before hand what to do, did not put his Lance in his Reſt, but carried it ſo, that it flew over her head without encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring her. She ſoon ſaw the reaſon of his miſſing her, and, being angry at his generoſity, turned back her Horſe, and cried out, <hi>Sir Knight, although you ſo much contemn the forces of a Woman, yet, I hope, before I leave the Field, to make you ſenſible of my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;</hi> and if you will turn back, let us again encounter. He ſtayed not to return her an anſwer; but, being followed by his Troop of one thouſand Men, paſſed on to the Body of her Army, and then he ſhewed, by the mightineſs of his blows, that he was not guilty of any cowardiſe; for he had killed, or diſmounted, ſix, before his Lance brake; and then, drawing his Sword, he at ſix blows ſent as many more into the other World: and being angry at the blow the Princeſs had given him, he was reſolved to revenge it on her Followers. By this time he was paſſed the firſt Battle, and was come to the ſecond, which was commanded by the King of <hi>Albania,</hi> and him he met to his dammage; for although he was a very valiant Knight, yet he gave him a wound over the arm, and the Sword falling heavily on the Horſes neck, cut off his head, ſo that he was diſmounted: but he was ſoon reſcued by his Followers. And now our <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince thought it was time to whéel about, and ſée how his Army was entertained by their Enemies; and indéed full time it was for him to do ſo; for he found the Fore-front of his Army in very great diſorder, by the valiant exploits of the unmatchable <hi>Floreza,</hi> who had ſo laid about her, that ſhe had kill'd, or diſmounted, above twenty, with her own hand, and had thereby made ſuch way for her Followers, that that whole Squadron was almoſt put to the rout. The
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49948:138"/>Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> ſéeing this, fled to the Rear of them, and there cauſed them to face about, and in ſhort time, by this ſtratagem, he had brought all thoſe who were flying in the Van, to be in the Rear; and thoſe in the Rear, who had not known of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter, were now in the Van: and he did then, in the head of theſe Forces, ſo lay about him, that he ſtopt his Enemies, and gave his own Men the time and conveniency to rally. By this means his Forces were in as good condition almoſt, as they had béen in the beginning of the Battle; which the Princeſs <hi>Floreza</hi> ſéeing, was reſolved again to aſſault him; wherefore command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that an hundred of her beſt Knights ſhould kéep near her, and by all means kéep the <hi>Numidian</hi> from paſſing from her, ſhe ſet forwards; and being come within hearing of him, ſhe cried out, <hi>Now, Sir Knight, ſince you would not make uſe of your Lance againſt me, let me ſee what you can do vvith your Svvord; for aſſure your ſelf, that I vvill do my utmoſt endeavor againſt you vvith mine; and I hope to make you knovv, that I have an arm as capable and ſtrong to vv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince was ſo ſurprized with this unexpected, but moſt pleaſant ſight, that he ſtood with his Sword in his hand like a dead ſtatue; but ſhe ſoon put life in him again; for now her anger being raiſed to the higheſt pitch,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49948:139"/>ſhe likewiſe raiſed her Sword, and ſaluted him with a powerful blow on the Helmet; which although it for the preſent blinded his eyes, yet his underſtanding was clear, and he refuſed to take the advantage he had againſt her, of aſſaulting her unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſhe was; but reſolving to be gone, he was likewiſe reſolved to have ſome benefit of the combat; for he ſeizing her in his arms, catcht hold of that fair gréen Scarf that held her Sword-ſcabberd, and lifting it over her head, turned his Horſe, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of all the reſiſtance her Knights could make, he made his way through them, and ſo returned to his Army. During the time of this combat all the Forces of both Armies had the leiſure to ingage themſelves, and that with indifferent fortunes; for as he poſſeſſed his Souldiers with a courage, ſo did ſhe thoſe under her command: and thoſe Chiefs that they had appointed on both ſides over their ſeveral Squadrons, being Perſons of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and valour, had worthily diſcharged their places. But the Army of the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> having béen always uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, were reſolved to do ſo now too; and therefore they laid about them ſo valiantly, that their Enemies were fored to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw. The Princeſs <hi>Floreza</hi> ſéeing this, and being enraged as well at the miſfortune of her ſelf, as that of her Army, ſhe ſene away immediately to the City, to command thoſe Forces there, under the conduct of the Knight of the <hi>Tyger,</hi> to advance; and in the mean time ſhe uſed all poſſible diligence to rally her ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Forces: ſhe did ſo, and had put them again in the beſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that time and place would permit, When ſhe ſaw her freſh Forces iſſue out of the City, as this cauſed an univerſal Joy to her and her People, ſo it was as much cauſe of ſorrow to the valiant <hi>Numidian;</hi> who by this underſtood that the fight would be very bloody, and that he muſt be forced to fight it out to the laſt man: he was ſorry to find it ſo, but being reſolved, to do all things that might be done by a good General, he ſent away to his Camp, to command thoſe Forces that he had left there to quit the Camp, and advance towards the place of Battle; put not to make their approaches ſo near as to be diſcovered by either Army, but to ſtay in ſome near convenient place, and expect his Commands. His Orders were obeyed; but before they could arrive at him, the Enemy was advancing with the recruit of freſh Forces.

                        </gap>t, and went to thoſe Forces he had ordered as a Reſerve; when he came to them, he cried out, <hi>Come, Fellow-Souldiers, there is only your aſſiſtance wanting to put an end to this days work, and reap the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Battle that hath been well fought; do but now ſhow your reſolutions to continue what you have been, Conquerors, and we ſhall ſoon be ſo.</hi> They anſwered him with ſuch a ſhout, as demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their joy and willingneſs to follow him: wherefore he, being at the head of this Party, flew like lightning, and in a inſtant was up with his Enemies, who were mightily ſurpized with this aſſault. They bore it as couragiouſly as they could; but theſe freſh Forces coming with freſh reſolutions, to die or conquer, made their Enemies know, that they were led by one who was no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the Art of War. The gallant Princeſs did all ſhe could to hinder her Enemies, from a Victory, which ſhe ſaw they were reſolved to have; but ſéeing it was in vain, ſhe, like a prudent General, cauſed the retreat to be ſounded. The <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince hearing of it, was reſolved not to diſoblige her further, but give her the ſatiſfaction ſhe deſired: but although he, as well as ſhe, had cauſed the retreat to be ſounded, yet his Souldiers could not be eaſily brought off from the work they were ingaged in, in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and vanquiſhing their Enemies. But now the night coming on, did that for them both which they were ſo deſirous of, for it ſeparated the two Armies; and the valiant Princeſs found her loſs ſo conſiderable, that ſhe thought it neceſſary to quit the Field to her Enemies, and enter the City, being the better place of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. She put this her reſolution into execution, but not ſo well, but that ſhe had a great loſs by it; for ſeveral believing that now they ſhould be again incloſed within the City walls, choſe rather to flée away, or fall into their Enemies hands, and ſo they did: and alſo the Camp of the <hi>Numidian</hi> was much inriched by the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49948:140"/>plunder of the Field. Thus was the fortune of the Wars altered; and what this valiant Princeſs had béen ſome moneths in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together, was in one day ſeparated, or vanq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next day, upon a view of the Field, there were an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men ſlain on both ſides; but it was ſuppoſed two thirds of them were of the Princeſſes party: but ſhe, who began with leſs Forces then now ſhe had, was not ſo much diſcouraged as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, but hoped for a better day; and in expectation thereof, was content with her preſent fortune. In order to the management of her Affairs, ſhe ſent out to raiſe Forces, not only in all the Dominions of her Brother, but ſhe alſo ſent to all her Allies, which were ſo many, and they ſo forward in her aſſiſtance, that ſhe queſtioned not but, in ſhort time, ſhe ſhould be in condition to take the Field again: till when ſhe made ſeveral excurſions; and notwithſtanding all that the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> could do to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her, yet ſhe ſeveral times got in ſome Recruits, with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary proviſion; and he indéed was ſo concerned for her ever ſince that fatal day whereon he diſarmed her head, that he knew not what to think of it; but in the end he diſcovered that the little god <hi>Cupid</hi> had wounded him ſo déeply, that he muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and yield to thoſe whom he had conquered. But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that, and other tranſactions that happened upon that account, being many and various.

He being ſenſible of his ill fortune, complained to the great god <hi>Mars,</hi> that he had permitted him, who was his abſolute Votary, to be overcome by that little god <hi>Cupid.</hi> But conſidering the all-powerful charms of <hi>Venus,</hi> who oftentimes inforced <hi>Mars</hi> himſelf to ſubmit to her, was reſolved to be content; and ſince he was wounded, to indeavor a remedy. There was none capable to cure him, but ſhe alone that wounded him, and he know her to be his enemy; but however, believing her to be as generous, as ſhe was fair and couragious, he took pen, ink, and paper, and writ theſe lines to her.</p>

Indeed we have the honour of keeping the Field which you quitted, and found ſome Trophies there which were conſiderable; but all to me is inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in reſpect of that glorious Scarf which I obtained of you, and which I prize above all elſe I could have purchaſed. I hope, Madam, ſince I won it in the Field, you will give me leave to wear it as a glorious Trophy; and not to take it as other people may do, that I wear it in ſign of victory over you, when as all my ambition in having the honour of wearing it, is to ſignifie that I fight under your colours: although this may ſeem to be a paradox, yet aſſure your ſelf of the truth of it; and ſetting aſide the truſt I have of commanding the Forces of my Uncle, I ſhould come immediately and preſent my Perſon to be commanded by you. Madam, conſider my condition with you, and conſider my quality with my Uncle, and command me any thing which you think is generouſly fit to be done, and aſſure your ſelf you ſhall command</p>

                           <p>YOur Letter hath very much ſurprized me; for I expected ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in it in order to the proſecution of the old War, and you propoſe a new one: it were neceſſary that the firſt were finiſhed, before any treaty of the ſecond; for how can I think you to be my Friend, when you are in arms in my own Country againſt our Subjects, and have already ſacrificed ſo many of their lives to your ambition of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire? You may anſwer, that the War was begun by my Brother, and proſecuted by you as an Enemy to him: but I cannot take him to be my Friend, who is his Enemy. As for your generoſity in offering your ſervice to me, I thank you, and found you friendly, when in arms I took you for an Enemy. If you are obliged to ſerve, and be true to your Uncle, who hath intruſted you with his Army, I have a double obligation on the ſame account; for I am not only intruſted by the Emperor my Brother, but the love of, and my duty to my Country, requires my aſſiſtance of it in this extremity. As for thoſe Trophies you won in the Field, as I cannot hinder, ſo I ſhall not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid your uſing them as you pleaſe. And as you deſire me to conſider your condition with your Uncle, ſo, I think, you ought to conſider of mine with my Brother, and my Country, to whom I am more obliged then you can be; otherwiſe, ſetting this aſide, it may be I ſhould be as generous as you. I confeſs, you might have proſecuted your Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt us with ſomewhat more rigor; for you did ſpare, where you might have killed: but I hope, if the War continue, I may have the ſame advantage againſt you, when, you may expect, I will make the ſame uſe of it. This is all at preſent from her, who although ſhe is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to be your Enemy, yet ſhe will endeavor to anſwer your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity:</p>

                     <p>The Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> was highly contented with this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and had great hopes of a handſome proſecution in his love; which although it was not encouraged, yet he was not bid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. But as he was a Lover, ſo he was the General of an Army, and his care was to be employed in proſecuting the War: he had ſome inclinations to propoſe of a Peace to the Princeſs; but he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49948:142"/>thought it would be better to wait till the arrival of thoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who he heard were approaching, under the command of the Knight of <hi>Hope,</hi> which in few days came up to the Army.</p>
                     <p>It was then ſuppoſed neceſſary to procéed, and lay a cloſe ſiege to the City; but they were hindred from doing ſo, by the arrival of ſixty thouſand men, under the conduct of <hi>Periſano,</hi> Knight of the <hi>Panther,</hi> who was one of the principal of the Nobility of <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bizond,</hi> and withal was amorous of, though not beloved by, the Princeſs <hi>Floreza.</hi> This Knight of the <hi>Panther</hi> was a proud am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Perſon; and had carried himſelf ſo arrogantly in the count ſhip of the Princeſs, that ſhe had wholly refuſed him: but he now, ſuppoſing he ſhould either oblige her by fair means, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this aſſiſtance to her in this extremity, or elſe be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel her by force; he therefore had raiſed theſe Forces, and now came to her aſſiſtance. Although ſhe knew his pretenſions, yet ſhe took no notice of that; but welcomed him, and told him, that the Emperor, her Brother, would acknowledge this as a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſervice; and, that ſhe would endeavor, that her Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould, in due time, recompence him. He returned this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that he did not, nor could not expect any recompence from him, who was himſelf in priſon, and whom he looked upon as one out of the World; but his reward he expected from her ſelf, whom he acknowledged his only Sovereign; and the recompence he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, ſhe very well knew of: and in requital of it, he queſtioned not but to rid her, and that Empire, of all their Enemies; that they together might reap the fruits of ſuch a Peace as he would aſſuredly give her. She, hearing his arrogant expreſſions, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that ſhe ſhould never think otherwiſe of her ſelf then as a Subject, ſo long as her Brother was living; and therefore to be wholly diſpoſed by him: but if he would joyn with her, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their Enemies, ſhe was ready to accept him. He replied, be was come for that purpoſe; but withal, that ſhe knew his mind. This valiant and diſcréet Princeſs was very much troubled at the arrogancy of this vain-glorious Knight, but was reſolved to diſſemble her knowledge of his intentions, and, if poſſible, to gain the Chiefs of his Army to her diſpoſe: but as yet, ſhe thought it would be convenient to be ſilent, and ſée how the fortune of the War was likely to procéed; and therefore propoſed to iſſue out of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49948:142"/>the City, and aſſault their Enemies in their Camp. The Knight of the <hi>Panther</hi> was very ready to entertain this propoſition; and therefore told her, that he was provided to execute her commands when ſhe pleaſed, and promiſed to do great marvels on the day of Battel; but when the day came, and he and all his Forces were joyned with their Enemies, yet, although he was ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

And the Prince <hi>Baltazano</hi> was full of uncertainties, what courſe to take in the proſecution of his love; for he had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that the Knight of the <hi>Panther,</hi> who commanded the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that lately relieved the Princeſs, was alſo her Servant; but whether he was accepted, or countenanced by her, he knew not. Wherefore in theſe irreſolutions we will at preſent leave him, before the City of <hi>Pharez,</hi> engaged both in Love and War, in both which he will be for ſome time engaged; and now we will return to <hi>Babylon,</hi> where we left the Souldan and his Empreſs, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by their valiant Son in Law <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> and their fair Daughter <hi>Florisbella;</hi> the two valiant Princes, <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> and <hi>Don Lucidamore,</hi> and ſeveral other great and worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages.</p>
                     <p>The Court of the Souldan of <hi>Babylon</hi> was never filled with more joy and tranquillity then on this occaſion, eſpecially when it was known, that the fair Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> was with Child: this was very pleaſing, not only to the whole Court, but to all the Subjects of this great Empire: and the time of her lying in being come, great and ſplendid proviſion was made to entertain the Princely Babe. But the joy of all was more then ordinary when ſhe was brought to bed, not only of a brave Son, but he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by as lovely a Daughter: Theſe two were wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their births; for, beſides that the ordinary lineaments of their body were in the higheſt perfection, they had extraordinary
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49948:143"/>marks: the Son had the perfect figure of thrée Crowns on his breaſt, lively repreſented; and the Daughter had as many Roſes on her left arm. At the ſight of theſe ſo remarkable marks, all the Cout was full of diſcourſe, what ſhould be the meaning; for it was concluded by all, that they did admit of ſome extraordinary interpretation. Various were the opinions of all; and nothing being agréed upon, the Sages, and Wiſe Men of the Kingdom were ſent to, who ſent this anſwer.</p>

                     <p>This Propheſie was brought to the Court, and preſented to the Souldan, and <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> who ſéeing the contents of it would not be very pleaſing, they therefore reſolved to conceal it from the knowledge of all, truſting Fate to diſpoſe of them, and hoping for the beſt.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49948:143"/>Father and Grand-father of theſe two Princes were very glad that ſix moneths were paſſed; hoping that they by taking the ſame care of kéeping and guarding them, might hinder the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the threatning Propheſie. The Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> was mightily well pleaſed with the thriving of her Children, but was diſſatisfied at their being ſo ſtrictly guarded; and had ſeveral times inquired of her Husband the cauſe why they could not be bred up in the Court with her. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſtill concealed the true cauſe of their confinements, and replied, that it was out of ſtate; and that it would be better for the Children; while they were ſo young, to be bred privately then otherwiſe; promiſing, that ſo ſoon as one year was paſt, by which time they would be capable of knowing them, to permit them to be brought to, and bred up in the Court: and with this anſwer the Princeſs was forced to reſt ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>The news of the birth of theſe two heave Princes being ſpread abroad, was ſoon carried, not only to all parts of the Empire, but it alſo came to the hearing of <hi>Don Brianel</hi> and <hi>Aurora,</hi> King and Quéen of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who, believing they ſhould oblige <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his Princeſs, ſent their Daughter <hi>Aurora</hi> to be been up with them in the Court of <hi>Babylon:</hi> and, by their example, <hi>Alfiron</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> King and Quéen of <hi>Shyraz,</hi> alſo ſent their Daughter <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians;</hi> for whoſe arrival at Court, great joy was made. And now the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> was again deſirous that her two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might he brought to Court, to accompany theſe two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> promiſed her, that her deſire ſhould in ſhort time be granted; but that he muſt firſt have the conſent of her Father, the Souldan, before it could be done. The Princeſs hearing, and underſtanding, that if ſhe could have her Fathers conſent, her Husbands would be had; ſhe therefore became a Suitor to her Father in that be half: He anſwered her, as her Husband had done, that in ſhort time ſhe ſhould have her deſires fulfilled. But ſhe was ſo importunate with both her Huſband and Father, that ſhe cauſed them to promiſe her that on a day prefixed, which was to come within one moneth more, the two Princes ſhould he brought to Court.</p>
                     <p>She waited the coming of that day with ſome impatience; and when it was come, a great Feaſt was provided, and Triumths

But a little before the approaching of the night, when the Combatants were ſeparated, there were two Chariots ſéen in the Air, drawn by ſix Griffons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece; they came from ſeveral ways, for one came from the Eaſt, and the other from the Weſt; and méeting in the Air, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a furious Combat with each other, which continued for ſome time in the Air, to the admiration of all the beholders; but they in the end ſeparated, and both whéeling about, alighted in the place where the Tilting had béen performed: out of one of theſe Chariots iſſued a Giant, and in his hand two Lions, who went towards the Scaffold where the two young Princes, <hi>Meridian,</hi> and <hi>Clarinda,</hi> were ſeated; but before they could come thither, they were met and oppoſed by another Giant, and two fierce Lecpards, who came out of the other Chariot; betwéen theſe two
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49948:144"/>Giants began a fierce and cruel Combat; for they drawing their mighty broad Falchions, ſoon drew blood from one another: in the mean time the Beaſts were not idle, for they aſſaulted each other with great violence; and in the end of a cruel Combat, which was begun, continued, and ended by theſe Giants, and Beaſts, to the admiration of all the beholders, the Giant with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was vanquiſhed by the other; and a great peal of Thunder, and flaſh of Lightning happening, the Chariof out of which the vanquiſhed Giant and Lions came was vaniſhed, and ſo was the Giant and Lions; and the other Giant ſéeing himſelf Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, taking his Leopards in his hand, went up to the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold where the two young Princes were, and taking them into his arms, bore them away; and carrying them to the Chariot, he entred with them there, and the two Leopards, lying at the féet of the two Princes; immediately the Griffons flew up into the Air, drawing the Chariot after them: and thus were theſe two Princes born away, to the great grief and aſtoniſhment of the beholders.</p>

                     <p>Much ſatisfaction did the valorous Prince <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> receive at the reading of this Letter, knowing that whatever the ſage <hi>Bellona</hi> did undertake and promiſe, was true, and would turn to his advantage; and therefore he ſpurred on amain, and coming to the Chamber where the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> was in this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable condition, and accompanied by her Father and Mother, who made as great lamentations as ſhe, he told them, that they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49948:145"/>might ceaſe their lamentations and complaints, for he had already received intelligence of his Children; and to ſatisfie them what, he drew out the Letter he had received, and read it unto them. At the reading of this Letter, and the diſcourſe he made upon it, and the arguments he uſed to convince them of the truth of it, they, in the end, reſted very well contented, and were reſolved to be ſatiſfied with their condition; which although they concluded it to be a miſfortune, yet ſince the ſage <hi>Bellona</hi> had promiſed, and undertook for them, they queſtioned not but in the end of all, things would happen as ſhe had declared.</p>
                     <p>This unfortunate Adventure being ended, and all the Princes indifferently well ſatiſfied, the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> having loſt her own Children, was mightily comforted by the preſence of the two young Princeſſes, <hi>Aurora</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Belliana</hi> of <hi>Shyraz,</hi> whoſe excellent beauties were the ornament and wonder of the whole World; and although their Parents (hearing of the loſs of the two Princes) did ſend for their Daughters, yet the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> made ſuch Apologies, and uſed ſo many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to retain them, that, in the end, their Parents were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they ſhould continue where they were.</p>
                     <p>And now the two valiant Princes, <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Don Lucidamore</hi> of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> ſéeing their Brother ſo well beſtowed in marriage, they deſired leave of him to return to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to attend their Father. He knowing that their deſires were but reaſonable, and that he was in duty bound to do the ſame, and his own Affairs (conſidering the preſent War with the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> not being ended) not permitting him to leave the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan at preſent; he therefore gave leave unto his two Brothers to depart with what conveniency they could, promiſing them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with all convenient ſpéed; and ſending Letters by them from himſelf, from the Souldan, and from his Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> to his Father and Mother, they departed, in company of ſeveral Grecian Knights who had accompanied them thither, and who now made up a conſiderable train.</p>
                     <p>They being thus accompanied, travelled through all thoſe vaſt Countries that ſeparate <hi>Babylon</hi> from <hi>Greece,</hi> without méeting with any conſiderable Adventure; and they were now entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the confines of their own Country, when, one morning early,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49948:146"/>they were overtook by a Damſel, who ſéemed to be in great haſte, and made pitious lamentation. Theſe two worthy Princes, knowing that by the Order of Knighthood théy were bound to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt all diſtreſſed Damſels, asked her the occaſion of her haſte. She anſwered, that ſhe was with all ſpéed journeying to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to carry news thither that would not be very pleaſant; and to ſée if ſhe could get any remedy for a miſfortune that was lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen. They told her, that their journey was thither alſo; and that they were ſo concerned with the Affairs of that place, that if ſhe pleaſed to acquaint them with her buſineſs, they promiſed her their aſſiſtance, She ſéeing them ſuch likely Knights, and ſo well accompanied, and hoping ſhe might ſave her ſelf the trouble of any further travel, anſwered them thus:</p>
                     <p>Know then, worthy Knights, that I belong unto a Princeſs named <hi>Leonarda,</hi> whoſe Father is a conſiderable Subject to the Emperor <hi>Don Bellaneo;</hi> and this Lady, being both fair and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, was beloved and courted by ſeveral great Perſonages; but more particularly, by the virtuous <hi>Arſileo,</hi> Prince of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and near Kinſman to the Emperor: he had long courted her, but the Emperor having occaſion to travel in ſearch of his Son <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis,</hi> took the Prince <hi>Arſileo</hi> with him; and in the time of his abſence, amongſt others that courted my Miſtreſs, <hi>Fuſtagon,</hi> the fierce and cruel Eiant, pretended to be chief. The Lady <hi>Leonar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> did never admit of any courtſhip from this fierce Lover; but he living in a Caſtle, near to that where ſhe dwelt with her Father, and ſometimes riding abroad, he would take ſome opportunities of ſéeing her, and tendring his love to her. She, who was reſolved to have none but the Prince <hi>Arſileo,</hi> refuſed <hi>Fuſtagon,</hi> and all others; and notwithſtanding his many Letters and Preſents, wholly refuſed him. But he, being very amorous of her, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>lved to have her, either by fair means, or compulſion; and to that end he laid many plots, how to ſurprize her: but ſhe, being kept with her Father, in his Caſtle, which was defended with many Knights of his retinue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he had not the opportunity of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing her by force; but at length he, waiting all opportunities, found one, to execute his villanous deſign. For news being brought that the Emperor <hi>Don Bellaneo,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Arſileo,</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, were returned to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> from <hi>Perſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49948:146"/>Father of the Princeſs <hi>Leonarda,</hi> out of dutiful reſpect to the Emperor, thought it neceſſary for him to go to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and welcome him home: accordingly he, and moſt of his retinue, went thither; but no ſooner was be ſet forwards on his journey to the Emperor's Court, but the wicked <hi>Fuſtagon,</hi> waiting his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, gaſned poſſeſſion of the Caſtle where <hi>Leonarda</hi> was; and firſt attempting her by fair means, and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I being one of her principal Damſels, attended her in that unpleaſant journey; where, when we came, the poor Princeſs was made Priſoner, and, without any reſpect to her ſex or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, unkindly treated: and ſhe refuſing to accept him for a Husband, he told her, that then ſhe muſt reſolve to permit him to enjoy her, or elſe he would compel her by for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this cunning Villain, <hi>Fuſtagon,</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting ſome ſuch matter, and believing that if he could get the Father, or Lover, into his power, that then he might accompliſh his ends upon the Princeſs; he therefore put himſelf in the way that they were to come; and having a parcel of Knights, as wicked as himſelf, who had promiſed to aſſiſt him in his wicked deſign: ſuch was the miſfortune of my Princeſs, that he met, fought with, vanq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She was mightily perplexed at her great miſfortune; and all that ſhe could gain of this Monſter was, to give h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> a moneths time to conſider of this matter, promiſing then to give him a poſitive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. And this ſhe did, in hopes to be relieved by ſome of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Subjects; but they faling her, ſhe made ſuch ſhift, as ſhe not me out of the Caſtle, commanding me to go with all ſpéed to the Emperor's Court, to get aſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtance from thence.</p>
                     <p>And thus, continued this Damſel, have I given you a brief, but true account of my Princeſſes miſfortunes, and the cauſe of

                     <p>The two Princes, <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> and <hi>Don Lucidamore,</hi> néeded not many arguments to induce them to aſſiſt in ſo juſt a cauſe; not only the defence and aſſiſtance of all Ladies in general obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them thereto, but that in particular, of a Lady their Fathers Subject, whom they very well knew; and their near and dear Kin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now being upon their way, they inquired ſeveral things of her; as firſt, how far it was thither? To which ſhe replied, not above one days journey. Then, how this Giant, <hi>Fuſtagon,</hi> was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied? and how they might get into his Caſtle? To this the Damſel replied, that he had two hundred Knights in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany within the Caſtle, and had twice that number in places not far diſtant; and that ſeveral wicked Knights did every day come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> to him to his aſſiſtance, all which he entertained, fearing and expecting Forces from my Ladies Fathers Subjects, or from the Emperor, to come againſt them: and therefore he is ſo well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Knights within and without; and the Caſtle is ſo well fortified, that it will be a very difficult enterprize to gain it by force; wherefore it will be better, in my opinion, ſaid ſhe, for ſome to get in by policy, and ſo ſurprize it. The Damſels coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was very well approved of; and they, now riding on, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within two miles of the place, again conſulted what was to be done; and thereupon they reſolved; to divide themſelves into thrée Squadrons, which ſhould all be that night, about midnight, within hearing of the ſound of a Trumpet of the Caſtle, and then ſhould attempt to enter; and that <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> and five more valiant and reſolved Knights, would get in as Friends to <hi>Fuſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> and ſo let in the reſt, and perform their enterprize. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus reſolved upon, <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> and the five other Knights in his Company, marched on alone (leaving the Damſel to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

They replied, they were Friends, and came to ſpeak with their Lord <hi>Fuſtagon.</hi> When they had thus anſwered, they came nearer, and were come to the Caſtle Gate; and the Guard there ſéeing them ſo few in company, permitted them to enter; and they were preſently conducted to the preſence of <hi>Fuſtagon:</hi> When they came near him, <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> ſaluted him, telling him, that he belonged to a near Kinſman of his, named <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To this <hi>Fuſtagon</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that they were very welcome; but he did believe, that he ſhould not have any occaſion to trouble his Kinſman; for he hoped that the Lady <hi>Leonarda</hi> would grant his deſires fairly, and then all would be well again: but, ſaid he, ſince you are come, I pray ſtay with me two or thrée days, and then, if my buſineſs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, I may ſend you back to my Kinſman, and acquaint him how things are. They were well enough ſatiſfied with this anſwer, and thereupon walked about with him in the Caſtle, he giving them an account of his affairs, and ſhewing them the ſtrength of the Caſtle; this was much to their purpoſe, and therefore they took good héed to all things; and ſo they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to their lodgings, where they were diſarmed, and ſupped with <hi>Fuſtagon;</hi> who brought out the ſorrowful Lady, <hi>Leonarda,</hi> into their company, telling her, that his Kinſman, <hi>Barſtoon,</hi> had ſent him thoſe Knights for his aſſiſtance, and was coming with a great Train; ſo that he knew himſelf able to kéep that by force, not only againſt all her Fathers Subjects, but alſo againſt all the Knights in the Emperor's Court: therefore, ſaid he, it will be diſcretion in you to grant that fairly, which will be ſo much to your prejudice to deny, and in the end muſt, in deſpight of you, be obtained; for, concluded he, I vow ſolemnly, if you do not grant my requeſt, and that within theſe four days, I will cauſe the heads of your Father and Lover to be ſmitten off before your

And now all People, but the Centinels and Watch, being aſléep, and our Knights being arin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, iſſued out of their lodgings, and went to the Caſtle Gates, where they quickly ſlew ſome of the Centinels and Watch; but there was ſuch a noiſe, that the whole Caſtle was alarm'd; whereupon one of the Knights went up to the Battlements of the Caſtle, and ſounded a Trumpet; and <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> and the other four, ſo laid about them, that they had killed moſt of the Guard; and poſſeſſing themſelves of the keys had opened the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Gate, expecting their aid. The Giant, <hi>Fuſtagon,</hi> was not ſo ſoundly aſléep, but that, at the noiſe he heard, he aroſe; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, what was the cauſe thereof? he was told, that the ſix Knights, who were entertained the day before from his Couſin <hi>Barſtoon,</hi> had attempted to poſſeſs themſelves of the Caſtle; that they had killed ſeveral of the Guards, and had poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the keys. <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now, they being entred the broad yard of the Caſtle, began a very valiant fight; for <hi>Fuſtagon</hi> ſéeing their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and knowing his own in the Caſtle to excéed it, did not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but to vanquiſh and overcome his Enemies; wherefore he himſelf, at the head of his People, fought very valiantly; but he was ſoon of another mind; for it was not long after ere a ſecond, and after that the third Squadron, entred the Caſtle, ſo that he believed it would be to no purpoſe to reſiſt: however, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to do his utmoſt; and what he could not execute by force, to perform by policy; and therefore he retired; intending to ſecure himſelf of the Princeſs <hi>Leonarda,</hi> and if his Enemies would not deſiſt, to cut off her head. With this reſolution he left his Knights fighting, and went to her lodging; but not ſo cunningly, but that <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> who had an eye upon him, and doubting ſome ſuch deſperate act, followed him: when he came to the Princeſſes Chamber, ſhe was up in her night-gown, and ſéeing him come in all bloody, was mightily agaſt; but he ſoon taking her by the arm, led her to a large window which looked into the Court-yard, where the fight was maintained, and there he thus ſpake to her: <hi>Do you ſee, Minion, how much blood is ſhed on your occaſion? if you have a mind to preſerve your ſelf, call to them, and that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and command them to leave the fight, and be gone, or elſe I will deliver you to them, but it ſhall be headleſs.</hi> She ſhrieked out at this diſcourſe; which the Knights hearing, looked up, but knew not the meaning; only <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> who was at the very héels of <hi>Fuſtagon,</hi> and heard his diſcourſe, and doubted would do as he had ſaid, took hold of the Lady by the other arm, and drew her from her Enemy, and preſented himſelf in her ſtead, ſaying, <hi>Come, Monſter, exerciſe you ſelf on Knights that are armed, and not on poor defenceleſs Ladies.

                     <p>IUſt as the Giant, <hi>Fuſtagon,</hi> fell breathleſs on the ground, <hi>Don Arſileo</hi> entered the Chamber where the combat had béen fought; for he hearing a great noiſe in the Caſtle, and the Guards which were upon him leaving him to aſſiſt their Lord, he found the means to break open his Chamber-door; and deſcending into the Court, and ſéeing the fight, he miſſing <hi>Fuſtagon,</hi> and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for him, heard he was gone towards the lodgings of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; wherefore doubting ſome deſperate act, he ſeizing on a Sword, a Helmet, and Target, went thitherward, intending to aſſiſt and relieve the Princeſs, or elſe to loſe his own life in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting it: with this reſolution he entred the Chamber, juſt as the Giant fell; and ſéeing <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> his and his Ladies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, he fell down on his knées to render thanks to him for that great ſervice he had done them; but he was ſoon taken up by <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> who, pulling off his Helmet, diſcovered himſelf to his Kinſman; who ſoon knowing him, cried out, <hi>Oh, my good Lord! how much am I engaged to you for this great and immenſe favour?</hi> He would have procéeded in further diſcourſe of that nature, but that <hi>Don Glarineo</hi> interrupted him, and leaving him in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his Lady, went down to ſée how cauſes went there; but before he went, he cut off the head of the Giant, and placing it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49948:149"/>on his Swords point, went amongſt the Knights who were ſtill fighting. He therefore beholding them, advanced his Sword, and cried out, <hi>What is the intent of this your wilful fighting, ſince behold here the Head of your greateſt Enemy, which ſhould put an end to this combat?</hi> All the Combatants beheld, and heard him: and the Giants Knights ſéeing the head of their Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and withal finding themſelves over-powred, threw down their weapons, and cried out for quarter; which was ſoon granted them. And the Caſtle being in all parts ſecured, the Giants Knights diſarmed and impriſoned, the two valiant Princes, <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> and <hi>Don Lucidamore,</hi> again went to the Princeſſes lodgings, where they found her not only accompanied by her Lover <hi>Don Arſileo,</hi> but alſo by her Father, who was come thither to her, At the entrance of the two Princes, they would all thrée have fallen on their knées, but they would not permit it; but, being diſarmed, ſate down by them: and the Damſel who had met the two Princes, now entred, and joyfully fell down at the féet of her Lady, embracing her knées; but ſhe, underſtanding that ſhe was by her means relieved, ſoon took her up, and embracing her, gave her many thanks for her ſo good ſervice. In the end all Perſons were very well pleaſed; and our wearied Princes having refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves with ſuch viands as the Caſtle afforded, lay down to take ſome reſt; during which time <hi>Don Arſileo</hi> took charge of the Caſtle: and conſidering how their condition was, and that although they had overcome all the Forces within the Caſtle, yet there were more without who might interrupt their quiet; he therefore, by the advice and conſent of the Princeſs and her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, diſpatched away certain Knights (who were taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners with them, and now releaſed) to the Country of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes Father, to acquaint his Subjects of their Victory, and to command them to attend him there immediately, in the beſt manner they could. Theſe Meſſengers being ſent away, made ſuch diſpatch, that they ſoon arrived at the Caſtle of the Princeſs <hi>Leonarda's</hi> Father, where they found a young, Knight, a Kinſman of hers, called the Knight of the <hi>Stars,</hi> that had gathered a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable hand of Souldiers together, with intent to relieve their Lord and Lady; and now hearing of the joyful news of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and that they only wanted their aſſiſtance in conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49948:150"/>them home, they ſoon put themſelves in a readineſs to march thitherwards: and now many more, who before were fearful of the Giants power, knowing him dead, joyned themſelves to this Troop, ſo that their Forces were very conſiderable. And they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their way, we will leave them, and return to the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants Caſtle; where the two Princes, and their Companions, and Knights, having refreſhed themſelves, and being now met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to conſult what was neceſſary to be done, reſolved to leave the Caſtle, and journey towards the Princes: but they, knowing that the Giant had Forces in the way, thought convenient to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend till the Subjects of the Prince, who had been ſent to, ſhould come. But before their arrival there, a Squadron of the Giants Knights, who were quartered abroad, came to the Caſtle; but not being admitted entrance, much wondred at the cauſe, till at length they underſtood it; wherefore they ſent to, and acquainted the other Squadrons with the matter, deſiring them to come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to them, and they would attempt the re-taking of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. At this ſummons all the other Forces came up, and being met together, and reſolving what to do, they knowing a private and unknown way into the Caſtle, ſeveral of the moſt couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and adventurous of them entred a Vault which led into the Caſtle, the reſt ſtill ſtanding before the Caſtle Walls. Our va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Princes ſtood upon the Battlements, expecting the aſſault; but they were mightily ſurprized and amazed, when they ſaw a great number of armed Knights were entred the Caſtle, and they knew not which way; at length they perceived that they iſſued out of a Vault, and therefore they went thither to ſtop it: but thoſe who were already entred hindred them, and ingaged in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe who were without the Caſtle, ſeeing our Knights to quit the Walls, underſtood what was the occaſion of it, and that ſome of their Companions were entred the Caſtle, and had begun a ſight which they intended to aſſiſt them in; and thereupon, they being provided, with ſcaling Ladders, and other ſuch like warlike inſtruments, they mounted the Caſtle Walls; which our knights ſeeing, were forced to divide themſelves, and run, part of them, thither to reſiſt them. Thus were they ingaged in two ſeveral places, and the fight became very bloody; and in the end would
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49948:150"/>have béen very hazardous to our Princes, but that they perceived a great Troop, at ſome diſtance, marching up towards them, and it was not long ere they knew them to be their Friends; for they ſet upon the Aſſaylants ſo violently, that they cauſed them to leave the aſſault, and deſcend to aſſiſt their Companions; our knights ſéeing this, now bent all their Forces againſt thoſe who came up out of the Vault, whoſe numbers did not long increaſe, as they had done, becauſe they ſtaid in the Field, to help their Companions without the Caſtle; ſo that our Princes ſéeing that their enemies were but ſmall, and not likely now to increaſe, they laid ſo luſtily about them, that they put them into much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; for they did not underſtand the condition of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions without, and wondred that they had no more of their aſſiſtance. The Prince <hi>Arſileo,</hi> as being chiefly concerned, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed wonders, killing ſeveral knights with his own hand: and the Prince <hi>Clarineo</hi> again advanced the head of the Giant <hi>Fuſtagon</hi> on a Spear, on the Walls of the Caſtle: at the ſight of this, both Parties, as well thoſe within as without, ſéeing the head of their Chief, whom they did not believe to be dead, were ſo dead-hearted, that they gave way to their Enemies, and, throwing down their weapons, fled. Thoſe who were within the Caſtle were taken Priſoners, and diſpoſed amongſt their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; and the reſt without were purſued, and moſt of them ſlain by the hands of the mercileſs Country-men. And thus was this Adventure fully finiſhed, to the perfect joy of all the Princes; who ſetting open the Caſtle Gates, admitted the knight of the <hi>Stars,</hi> and all his Company, to enter the Caſtle. And now it was concluded that all the Princes, and the Princeſs <hi>Leonarda,</hi> ſhould leave that place, and travel to her Fathers Caſtle; and the cuſtody of that Caſtle was given to the knight of the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Few days ſtayed this Company to refreſh themſelves, and then they ſet on: the Company conſiſted of the old Prince, and his Daughter, the two Princes, <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> and <hi>Don Lucidamore,</hi> and <hi>Don Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſileo,</hi> and ſeveral good knights in their Company: and during this journey, <hi>Don Arſileo</hi> enjoyed ſo much pleaſure in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his beloved Lady, that he thought himſelf very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for all the pains he had taken, and the hazards he had underwent for her; and to make his joyes the more compleat, not only ſhe, but her Father alſo promiſed, that at his arrival at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> if the Emperor conſented, he ſhould be married to her.

And thus did they travel till they came to that great and famous City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where, when they came, they were met by the nobleſt of the Citizens, without the City, and ſoon after by all the Court; and at the Court Gates, by the Emperor and Empreſs. Great was the joy, on all ſides, for their ſo happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; for the Emperor had heard of all the Adventures at the Caſtle of <hi>Fuſtagon,</hi> and had intended to ſend them relief, but that he heard all was very well accompliſhed. The Empreſs was joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at the ſight of her Children; and after ſhe had embraced them, ſhe kindly received the Princeſs <hi>Leonarda,</hi> and her Couſin <hi>Arſileo;</hi> and ſhe and the Emperor, underſtanding the love that was betwéen them, conſented to their marriage; and ſent unto <hi>Hungary,</hi> to the king his Father, to acquaint him therewith. But the Emperor not queſtioning his conſent, in regard the Lady was not only fair, but diſcréet and virtuous, and the addition of <hi>Fuſtagon</hi>'s Dominions, to thoſe of her Fathers, being added, would make her a conſiderable Fortune; wherefore the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was agréed to be ſolemnized within ten days after: againſt which time, and as well in honour of the Wedding, as for joy of the ſafe return of the two Princes, <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> and <hi>Don Lucidamore,</hi> great proviſion was made for ſeveral Triumphs to be then had and kept, not only in the Court, but alſo in the City.</p>

He cauſed the Maſter of the Ship to put in at ſeveral Iſlands, where he went on ſhore, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and ſéek after the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena,</hi> or to find out ſome other Adventure; but he, méeting with nothing that was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, reſolved to ſail to <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and inquire what news was there to be heard of her. He, being landed at the Port, rode up into the Country, and his ears were ſoon ſaluted with the pleaſant noiſe of a Horn, and the cry of a pack of Hounds, that were in purſuit of a goodly Stag; he ſaw the Beaſt, and ſoon after the Company, which was large and gallant; for, upon inquiry, he underſtood, that there was the king and Queen, and moſt of the Court, and one Lady, who was more remarkable then the reſt, who was called <hi>Florida,</hi> and was Princeſs of <hi>Sicilia.</hi> This Lady was not only beautiful, but alſo of a brave, gallant, and generous aſpect, and ſo uſed to ride on hunting, that ſhe ſate upon her Horſe in a very becoming poſture. <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> was mightily taken with this Lady, and therefore rode up to her, and kept near her all the time of the hunting; and ſhe ſéeing him ſo gallant a Perſonage, was as curious in beholding him. The hunting being ended, by the death of the Stag, and the king, Quéen, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, being about to return to the Court, our knight turned about toleave their company: the Princeſs ſéeing that, cried out, <hi>Nay,</hi>

But ſhe, being deſirous to know it, commanded a Damſel, who attended her, to inquire it of his Dwarf. But eating-time being come, he was invited by the King to ſit down-with them; to which he conſented. The King alſo deſired to know his Quality: but he, being reſolved to conceal that, replied, That he was a <hi>Grecian</hi> Knight, of little fame, known by the name of the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> (he having the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of that blind god on his Shield.) At this anſwer the King was content; but ſo was not the Princeſs <hi>Florida,</hi> who earneſtly deſired to know his Quality; and therefore, that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe employed her Damſel; who although ſhe inquired of the Dwarf, yet ſhe loſt her labor: for he gave her no other anſwer, then his Lord had already given the King. <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> chanced to come by, where he ſaw the Damſel with his Dwarf; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowing her to belong to the Princeſs, he had ſome hopes of his ſuit; he believing that he might gather ſomewhat from the Servant of the mind of her Miſtreſs, took her by the hand, and asking, if ſhe pleaſed to command any thing of him? ſhe replied, No. Whereupon he asked his Dwarf, Whether ſhe had deſired
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49948:152"/>any thing of him? He, not daring to conceal any thing from his Lord and Maſter, preſently acquainted him with the deſires of the Damſel. Our Knight hearing this, told the Damſel, that his Dwarf, indéed, knew no more of him then he had ſaid; but if her Lady deſired any further knowledge of him, if ſhe pleaſed to admit him to a private conference, he would ſatisfie her in all ſhe pleaſed, and be ready to obey her in all her commands. The Damſel, making an obeyſance, left him, and went to her Lady; to whom ſhe recounted the ſubſtance of her meſſage, and withal added, that the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> was a very courteous Knight. The Princeſs ſpent that night, and the next day, in conſulting with her ſelf, what to do; and at laſt reſolved, to give him a méeting in the Garden that evening: and therefore commanded her Damſel to acquaint him, or the Dwarf, with her intentions. Our Knight, in the mean time, had made all diligent inquiry about the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena,</hi> but could not hear any news of her ſince ſhe left the Court with the Knight of the <hi>Keys:</hi> and although the King, being much grieved for the loſs of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, had made all diligent ſearch throughout all the adjoyning Countries, yet he could never hear any news of her, or of the Knight. After he had made his inquiry, and was paſſing through the Garden, he was met by the Princeſs of <hi>Sicilia's</hi> Damſel; who ſéeing him gave him the opportunity of ſaluting her. He ſoon inquired of her Ladies health; and, whether ſhe was ſtill deſirous of knowing any thing of him? She replied, that, indéed, her Lady was deſirous of a further acquaintance with him; and that, for her own part, ſhe ſhould be very willing to aſſiſt and contribute all ſhe could thereunto. He kindly thanking her, replied, that he ſhould be very thankful to her for any thing ſhe ſhould act for him, and ſhould endeavor to recompenſe her kindneſs; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as an earneſt of his good will to her, he pulling a Diamond King from his finger gave it unto her. She kindly accepted of his Preſent, and told him, in requital, that if he would pleaſe to méet her there that evening, about eleven of the Clock, ſhe would come; and ſhe hoped ſo to order the matter, that her Lady ſhould come with her. He, being glad of this propoſition, was very thankful; and, begging her to perform her promiſe, he promiſed not to fail on his part. She, having now very well diſcharged her

But, Sir, although you have given me great pleaſure and ſatisfaction in anſwering my firſt deſire, yet I ſhall not reſt there; but deſire you to anſwer my other more particularly, and I queſtion not, but I ſhall be as well, if not better, pleaſed with the knowledge of your true quality: wherefore, I pray, refuſe not to give me the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I expect.</hi> Our Knight, ſéeing the importunity of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and partly gueſſing at the reaſon of it, replied thus: <hi>Madam, ſince it muſt be ſo, I will be contented to obey you; provided you likewiſe promiſe me, not to declare your knowledge of me to the King, Queen, or any of the Court; but to carry your ſelf to me, as if you had not been acquainted with my quality.</hi> The Princeſs, being very earneſt to know this ſecret, promiſed all he deſired: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he thus replied; <hi>Madam, although my many occaſions have, for the greateſt part of my life, kept me in remore Countries, yet, I ſuppoſe, you have heard of me by my name, when I ſhall tell you, that I am called <hi>Clarineo</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and am Son unto the Emperor Don <hi>Bellaneo</hi> of <hi>Greece.</hi> Oh, my Lord!</hi> (replied the Princeſs) <hi>how will you pardon the diſreſpect I have had of you?</hi> and thereupon would have thrown her ſelf on her knées, and have kiſſed his hand; but he, ſéeing her intent, held her in his arms, kindly ſaluting her; and ſo they placed themſelves on a bench there adjoyning, where, when they were ſeated, the Prince thus began: <hi>Madam, I hope the knowledge of my name and quality will not prejudice me in your opinion; for I had rather be the meaneſt Knight in the World, and be eſteemed by you, then be Maſter of the greateſt Empire, and not

Ah, my Lord</hi> (replied ſhe) <hi>if I had a great eſteem for you, which I cannot but acknowledge, before I knew your quality, it is now much more increaſed, ſince I better know you; but, I doubt, the knowledge hereof will be to my diſadvantage, there being ſo great a diſtance in my quali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Although they ſpake again, it was but to diſcover that to one another which they well enough knew already; which was, their love to one another; and that they diſcovered more with their eyes, then their tongues were able to expreſs. But he, knowing it was convenient and neceſſary, promiſed her a laſting love: and ſhe confeſſed that hers was very violent ever ſince ſhe firſt ſaw him. <hi>And now, my Lord,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>I have made this confeſſion to you, what uſe will you make of it? will you leave me? or how will you diſpoſe of me? or order me how I ſhall diſpoſe of my ſelf.</hi> To this ſo paſſionate diſcourſe, he replied, <hi>That ſhe might command him what ſhe pleaſed, for he would be wholly directed by her: but</hi> (continued he) <hi>if it might ſtand with your good liking, I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute my intended voyage, in ſearch of the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena;</hi> and upon the firſt knowledge of her, or my return home, which ſhall firſt happen, I will certainly viſit you, either here, or in your Father's Court, and deſire you in marriage.</hi> She thanked him for this loving promiſe; but withal ſhe replied, <hi>That although he was very deſirous to hear news of her Kinſwoman <hi>Magdalena,</hi> yet there was ſo much hazard and danger in travelling to unknown Countries, that ſhe could hardly give her conſent to it.</hi> He replied, <hi>That he would make all poſſible haſte of his return, and then inviolably keep his word with her.</hi> She, hearing his reſolution, did not abſolutely contradict him, but then deſired to know, when he intended to depart? He replied, in four days. She was unwilling he ſhould be gone ſo ſuddenly. And thus did they ſpend ſome hours together in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in the Garden, and the Damſel ſtill walking at ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to ſpy if any ſhould chance to come to diſturb them; but ſhe, in the end, being weary of this employment, came to them,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49948:155"/>and teld them, that it would be more convenient for her, and them bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Prince hearing her propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, was very well pleaſed therewith; and deſired the Lady, to let it be as her Damſel had directed. She anſwered, and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by her ſilence; and ſo they went on. Being entred the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they ſate down on the ſide of the bed, and there they renewed their proteſtations of an inviolable love, which ſhould laſt till death. And now, having ſaid all that could be on that occaſion, the Prince was deſirous to procéed further with her; the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the time, place, and her great and accent affection to him, perſwaded him, that ſhe would not refuſe him; wherefore he again began with kiſſing and embracing her, and uſed all thoſe amorous actions that might induce her to be kind to him; ſo that in the end ſhe meltingly fell into his arms, and, as being wholly overcome by him, ſhe permitted him to take his full content and pleaſure with her. The Damſel was not far off, but had retired into an adjoyning Chamber, where ſhe lay till ſhe thought this love-paſſion was over, and then ſhe came out to them, telling them, that it was time for them to part, and him to be gone, for the day then approached, and it would be dangerous for him to ſtay there any longer. She underſtanding that the Damſel ſaid true, and doubting the worſt again, conjured the Prince to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and had a further promiſe of marriage, which he proteſted ſhould be at the furtheſt when he had ended the ſearch of the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena;</hi> and thereupon he gave her a King, before the Damſel, as a pledge of his faith, and as a token of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe he made her; and then, ſending out the Damſel to ſée if, any body were in the Garden, he took a ſolemn farewel of her; and the Damſel returning, and telling him that the coaſt was clear, he leſt his Lady, and departed to his Lodging. And now our Lovers had procéded thus far, they were more inamored of each other then they had béen; and during the time of his ſtay, he ſpent all the nights with her: and the fatal day being come of their ſeparation, they both ſéemed to be very much diſturbed; but ſhe, being reſolved to put a project ſhe had in her head into ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49948:156"/>He again promiſed to obey her in all things, and not to fail in any thing he had promiſed her; and now the very hour of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being come, and that he had taken his leave of the King and Quéen, and alſo of her, telling her, that he ſhould within one hour ſet ſail; and ſo he left her. She, in proſecution of her intention, having put all things into readineſs before, diſcoloured her Face, and made that ſomewhat brown that was before very fair and clear; and putting her ſelf into a Suit and Coat, habited like a Page, and turning up her own Hair, which was as yellow as the Gold, or rather as radiant as the Sun-beams, ſhe put on a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwig of another colour, and ſo diſguiſed her ſelf, that ſhe was hardly knowable to her ſelf; and putting a parcel of rich Iewels, and ſome Coin, into her pocket, and a Letter, which ſhe had written, into her hands, ſhe went to the Sea-ſide, where ſhe had not waited long before he came. She had ſo perfect a confidence, that he did not at all diſtruſt her; but ſhe, coming up to him, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a Letter to him; which he opening, read theſe words.</p>

And now, our Prince having ſailed to the weſtern parts of the World, he arrived at <hi>England,</hi> and there he landed, reſolving to viſit moſt of the conſiderable parts of that Kingdom; and therefore he cauſed thrée Horſes to be diſimbarqued, for himſelf, his Squire, <hi>Florello,</hi> and his Dwarf; and ordering his. Veſſel to ſail about moſt part of the Iſland, and méet him at <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> which is the neareſt Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Town in <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Ireland,</hi> whither he alſo intended to travel, and ſée if in the Country of his Friend, <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he might hear any news of the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena.</hi> He and his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants being thus mounted on horſe-back, they rode on towards the great and famous City of <hi>London,</hi> where the King of that Country kept his Court; being come thither, the King, and all the Court, were juſt then removing to the antient Caſtle of <hi>Windſor,</hi> for the trial of a Cauſe that was there within few days to be ended by Combat; the occaſion of which Combat was this:</p>
                     <p>A Counteſs of that Kingdom having thrée Children by her Husband, he died, leaving her a Widow; and ſhe ſeized upon the Eſtate for the uſe of her Children, they being as yet but young: The Earl, her Husband, had a Brother, who was very deſirous of having the Children in his kéeping, becauſe he might, under that pretence, receive the Rent of his Brother's Lands; but to this the Counteſs would in no wiſe agrée. Wherefore her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law was ſo angry, and being of a wicked and perverſe nature, being ambitious of Honour, and covetous of the Eſtate of his Brother, he had contrived a way how to gain all the Eſtate to himſelf; wherefore he, by great preſents in hand, and many fair promiſes of greater matters, drew into confederacy with him a Damſel, who had lived many years with his Siſter in Law; and her he cauſed to give out, that the thrée Children of her Lady were not begotten by the Earl her Husband, but by another who kept her company; by this means proving her Lady to be an Adultreſs, and the Children Baſtards. He ſéemed, at firſt, to be ſurprized at this ſtrange diſcourſe, which he himſelf had framed; but, as he ſaid, his Brother's Honour being in queſtion, he cauſed the wicked Damſel to be carried before the King; where
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49948:157"/>ſhe not only juſtified this report, but made oath of the ſame; whereupon the Counteſs was ſent for, but all the anſwer ſhe could give, was in the denial of the fact, with aſſeverations and tears. The King hearing the caſe, and intending, like a good Prince, to do juſtice, took this order; that, by a day prefixed, the Damſel ſhould provide a Champion, who ſhould maintain and juſtifie what ſhe had ſaid; and that the Counteſs ſhould likewiſe provide her Champion, to fight with the other in vindication of her honour; and that if the Damſels Champion ſhould be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, the Damſel ſhould be burnt alive; and if the Counteſſes Champion ſhould be vanquiſhed, ſhe and her Children ſhould be bereft of all the Eſtate of her dead Husband, and left to ſéek their fortunes where they could. This was ſet down by the King as abſolute. Now the time of this Combat approaching, the King was going to <hi>Windſor,</hi> which was the place appointed where it ſhould be fought. The Earl's Brother did before hand believe what would be the King's order in the matter; and therefore he had provided a Champion for the Damſel, who was a monſtrous great Giant, bred up in the Iſle of <hi>Man,</hi> a Country thereto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning. The Damſel being thus provided for, was out of all care and fear of further harm: but the Counteſs could not procure any to undertake her cauſe, (though all men believed her virtuous) ſo great was the terror every one had of this monſtrous Giant. And now was the time very near come, when the Combat was to be ſought; and all Perſons concerned, and a very great Aſſembly of People were come together to <hi>Windſor.</hi> Our Prince <hi>Clarineo,</hi> now known by the name of the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> went among others, and was very much concerned on the Counteſſes behalf; for he could not hear of any Champion that ſhe was provided with. He had ſome diſcourſes with his Squire <hi>Florello</hi> upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, telling him, that he wondred at the cowardiſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Knights, that would not undertake this Giant; adding, that if the Counteſs had no Champion, he himſelf would undertake her cauſe. <hi>Florello</hi> hearing this, and doubting ſome ſuch matter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>I queſtion not, my Lord, but that the Counceſs is wronged, and that ſhe hath bad fortune to have ſo monſtrous an Enemy, and none to undertake him; but withal, I think it would be deemed raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in you, who are wholly a ſtranger to her, to indanger your life
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49948:158"/>in a Combat ſo hazardous.</hi> The Prince replied, <hi>That he was bound, by the order of Knight-hood, to aſſiſt all Ladies, eſpecially thoſe that were diſtreſſed; and that he could not exerciſe his valour better then on this account: and</hi> (continued he) <hi>I ſhould not be worthy of my Lady <hi>Florida,</hi> if, for her ſake, I ſhall not aſſiſt thoſe that reſemble her. I, but</hi> (replied <hi>Florello</hi>) <hi>I know this, that if ſhe were here preſent, ſhe would hardly give conſent that you ſhould, upon any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoever, put your Perſon into ſo great hazard. I queſtion not but I ſhould perſwade her thereto,</hi> replied he; <hi>and to the end that you may hereafter acquaint her with this affair, we will go together to the Counteſs, and ſee in what condition ſhe is, and accordingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage for her.</hi> Hereupon they preſently went to the Counteſſes Lodgings, where they were admitted. The Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred, and ſate down, asked her, <hi>Whether ſhe was yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of a Champion?</hi> To which ſhe replied, <hi>No; and that the next day was the day appointed for the Combat: and then,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>my Children will be undone, and it ſhall be the laſt day of my life; for it will be impoſſible for me to our-live my ſhame: and if all fail, I will be my own Executioner.</hi> She having ended her lamentable diſcourſe, finiſhed with ſuch a deluge of tears, that drew compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from all there preſent.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of <hi>Gupid</hi> ſéeing ſo many accompany her in her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, and none offer to aſſiſt her in her cauſe, told her, <hi>That he had ſo much confidence in the juſtice of her cauſe and innocency, that he would undertake the Combat in her behalf.</hi> She, hearing what he had ſaid, replied, <hi>Ah! Sir Knight, how much am I obliged to you for your kind offer, which I dare not accept of? not ſo much out of a ſenſe of my own misfortune, as for fear of yours; for the Monſter, who is the Champion of my Adverſary, is ſo mighty, that he is thought to be able to encounter with four of the beſt and valianteſt Knights in this Kingdom: therefore, Sir Knight, I ſhould be mighty ſorry to adventure you ſingle againſt ſo vile a Monſter; and then, ſhould you miſcarry, as I doubt you muſt, although I am innocent, I ſhould be then concluded guilty, and you would to no purpoſe loſe your life in my defence; therefore I think it beſt to conclude my ſelf unfortunate, and not make others, who are wholly unconcerned, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with me.</hi> To this the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> replied; <hi>Madam, if you pleaſe to accept of me for your Champion, do not queſtion any thing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49948:158"/>elſe further; but leave all to Fate, that hath formerly ſtrengthened me to overcome and vanquiſh Enemies altogether as redoubtable as this Monſter.</hi> His Squire, <hi>Florello,</hi> hearing this, and being no longer able to forbear, ſaid, <hi>Good my Lord, conſider what you do; and remember, that as this Lady ſuppoſes ſhe can have little benefit by your aſſiſtance; ſo (you know) the Princeſs <hi>Florida</hi> will (if you be unfortunate) receive ſo great a grief, that it will be the ending of her days: and ſo you will thereby be the occaſion of the death of her your ſelf, and do no kindneſs for the Counteſs, but rather leave her the more ſuſpected. All that you can ſay</hi> (replied the Knight of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi>) <hi>is nothing, for I queſtion not the Victory, if there were two ſuch Monſters; ſo great confidence have I</hi> (ſaid he to the Counteſs) <hi>in the juſtneſs of your cauſe, and the aſſiſtance of that power that hath never yet failed me: therefore, if you pleaſe to accept me as your Champion, I will undertake the Combat on your behalf.</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, hearing his reſolution, kindly thanked him; and he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to fail the next day to be ready Armed at all points in the Field; and ſo they parted.</p>
                     <p>The next day being come, and the hour of the Combat ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and all things provided to receive the Combatants, Iudges, and Spectators, the King entred, and mounted on a Scaffold, where was alſo the Quéen, and the chiefeſt of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; two Iudges, who were appointed to be Iudges of the Field, ſate at the King's féet. The Counteſs, and her thrée Children, being clad in mourning apparel, ſate by themſelves; and the Damſel, with the Brother of the Earl, by themſelves, on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scaffold. All things being thus ordered, at the ſound of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Trumpets, the Giant entred the Liſts; he was mounted on a mighty Horſe, and armed with an Armor made of the Shells of ſeveral Fiſhes, which were harder then any Diamond: his Helmet was carried by one Knight on foot, and his Lance by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He being entred, the cauſe of the Combat was proclaimed, and the King's award thereupon: that done, the Iudges demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Damſel. <hi>If ſhe would ſtill juſtifie what ſhe had ſaid?</hi> She replied, <hi>Yes:</hi> and thereupon produced the Giant for her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion. The Counfeſs was then called to, and asked, <hi>Whether, or no, ſhe was guilty of the fact wherewith ſhe was charged?</hi> She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>Not guilly.</hi> And her Champion being demanded, ſhe told
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49948:159"/>the Iudges, <hi>That her chiefeſt Champion was the God of Juſtice, from whom ſhe expected and hoped for Juſtice; but for any humane Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, ſhe was unprovided.</hi> The Giant hearing this, began to prance about, and boaſtingly to ſay, <hi>What is it that deters theſe cowardly Knights, that they come not forth to the Battle? ſurely they all conclude her guilty, or elſe are fearful of my preſence; but if that be the cauſe, if any be ſo bold as to undertake her cauſe, I will ingage with any two, three, or four of them. That ſhall not need, proud Monſter,</hi> (replied the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> who was now entred the Liſts) <hi>for I my ſelf (if the Lady pleaſe) will undertake you alone; and I queſtion not, but, the juſtice of her cauſe aſſiſting me, to make you, in this place, repent theſe arrogant ſpeeches. Young Daſtard,</hi> (replied the Giant) <hi>what madneſs poſſeſſes your brain, to be ſo bold to come into my preſence, whoſe very looks have vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twenty ſuch Knights, and made them run away like ſheep? You ſhall find it much otherwiſe then you expect,</hi> (replied the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi>) <hi>as I hope, ere many hours are paſt: and therefore, Madam,</hi> (ſaid he to the Counteſs) <hi>I hope you will admit me for your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, and then I will do my utmoſt devoir to vindicate your Honour. Alas, Sir,</hi> (replied ſhe) <hi>I muſt, and do accept of you; and if you have but as good ſucceſs as my cauſe deſerves, you may (though as yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably) expect the better in the Combat.</hi> He made his reverence to her; and then went to the Iudges, who accordingly admitted him. He had hitherto béen bare-headed, and thereby diſcovered one of the moſt manly, but withal, the moſt pleaſant countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that had béen ſéen; and he did ſomewhat reſemble that blind god <hi>Cupid</hi> that was pictured on his Shield: ſo that all the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators did much pity, that one ſo young and handſome ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger himſelf againſt ſo monſtrous a Creature. He having now made his reverences to the King and Quéen, rode to the end of the Liſts, and took his Helmet from his Squire <hi>Florello,</hi> and his Lance from his Dwarf; and buckling on his Helmet, he, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Lance in his Reſt, expected the ſound of the Trumpets, which beginning, he ſpurred on amain, and encountring his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on the breſt, made him bend backwards; and he himſelf had ſuch an encounter on the Shield, that it much bruiſed it, and ſo they paſſed on: but both of them finding that their Lances were yet whole, and that they had not much dammaged one another,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49948:159"/>they again began another carere, which was performed with ſuch violence, that the Giant fell from his Horſe; and the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> was diſmounted, with his ſaddle betwéen his legs. The Giant, who was fallen, ſoon got on his féet, and, being inraged at his misfortune, drawing his Sword, came up to the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> who was hardly ready to receive him, he was ſo incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the ſaddle, ſo that he received a mighty blow on the Helmet, that he thought all had béen fire; but he coming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, returned the Giant ſo mighty a blow on the arm, that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way where the ſhells were cloſed, it much wounded him. He who had never found ſo weighty a blow from any Knight, or Giant, in all his life, was now ſo inraged, that ſéeing his blood come, he roared like a Bull, and lifting up his mighty Sword in the Air, intended to cleave the Knight in pieces; which he ſéeing avoided, but not ſo well, but that he was wounded in the leg. And now they, being both wounded, gave and received ſeveral blows, which made the blood to iſſue out of their wounds. Great was the wonder of the Spectators, ſéeing the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> hold out ſo valiantly againſt the Giant; who being ſo aſſured, as he thought, of the Victory, before he began, and now kept off ſo long, was grown mad with anger, and let fall ſo many blows, and ſo faſt, that he was out of breath. This the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> ſaw, and only warded them with his Shield, or ſtepping aſide avoided them. The Giant, although he was near tired with the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual pains he had taken, yet believing by the Knights only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending himſelf, and avoiding his blows, that he was near van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, laid on the faſter, and that ſo long, that he was forced to retire for breath; which the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> ſéeing, he made up to him, and now, being in good heart and luſty, he poured ſo many blows upon the Giant, that he wounded him in ſeveral places, he being ſo unweildy, that he could not turn away with that nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> had done; and now all were in good hopes that the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> would have the better of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat; for the Giant was ſo tired, that he could hardly defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, much leſs offend his Enemy; and the ſmart of his wounds much more tormented him. He was now therefore ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, that he fell in upon the Knight, and deſperately wounded him, though he received one himſelf; but being now near one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49948:160"/>the Giant advanced his Sword, and intended to have cut the Knight in twain; and much hurt it muſt of neceſſity have done him, had it hit him fully; but however, he was much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced by the blow: for their Swords méeting, the Giants Sword cut the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Sword in two. Thus was our poor Knight diſtreſſed, being thus diſatmed; and he had no way to help himſelf, but only by avoiding the blows of the Giant, who now forced him about the Field at his pleaſure. Much was the ſorrow of all the Aſſembly; but that of the Counteſs excéeded them all: but the Page <hi>Florello,</hi> at this killing ſpectacle, had fallen down in the Field, if the Dwarf had not catched hold of him. The Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> ſéeing the condition he was in, like a valiant Knight, did not deſpair; but watched all opportunities to cloſe with the Giant, and diſpoſſeſs him of his Sword; but that was not only difficult, but dangerous: wherefore he ſéeing a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-ax hanging at the ſaddle-bow of the Giant, reſolved to poſſeſs himſelf of that; wherefore he retired thitherwards, and being now near the Giant's Horſe, he threw the Hilt, and that part of his own Sword that remained in his hands, at the Giants head, that he was aſtoniſhed at the blow; and in the mean time ſeized on the Battle-ax. The Giant ſoon came from his aſtoniſhment, and now believing his Enemy to be quite weaponleſs, advanced towards him, but to his coſt; for he not doubting any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, came ſo near, that the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> hitting the Giant a blow with the mighty Battle-ax, cut off one of his arms, at which he roared like a baited Bull; and the Knight again following his blows, in two more laid him flat upon the earth, and ſo coming to him, and poſſeſſing himſelf of the Giant's Sword, he therewith ſmote off his head.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> having now, to the joy and admiration of the whole Company, killed his Enemy the Giant, and cut off his head with his own Sword, put it on the Swords point, and preſented it to the Counteſs; ſaying, <hi>Now, Madam, behold! the effects of your Prayers and Tears have given me the Victory over your Enemy; and if this be not enough, let me know what is further to be done.</hi> The Counteſs, coming down from the Scaffold, threw her ſelf at the Knight's féet, with many fears, embracing him: but he, taking her up, went to the King, and the Iudges, who told
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49948:160"/>him, <hi>The Conditions of the Combat ſhould be performed:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the falſe Damſel was ſeized on, and a pile of Faggots be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in readineſs, ſhe was carried thither to be burnt. She ſéeing that the end of her life was at hand, and being accompanied by ſome Religious Perſons, they ſo far wrought with her, that ſhe confeſſed, <hi>That the Accuſation ſhe had made of the Counteſs was falſe; and that ſhe was hired thereto by the Counteſſes Brother in Law.</hi> The King, and the Iudges, hearing of this, commanded her to be burnt immediately, as a puniſhment for her offence; and withal, baniſhed the Counteſſes Brother in Law; ſo that, if after twenty days he ſhould ever be ſéen in <hi>England,</hi> he ſhould be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And now juſtice being done on all ſides, the Quéen took the virtuous Counteſs, and her Children, into her company; and the King deſired the valiant Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> to go with him: the which he did, and ſtayed there with him ſeveral days; being all that time highly and honourably feaſted and entertained by the King, and all the Court.</p>
                     <p>But ſome few days being paſſed, and he hearing no news of what he ſearched for, the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena,</hi> in order to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, he paſſed thorow the principalleſt places in <hi>England,</hi> till he came to <hi>Weſtcheſter;</hi> where, méeting with his Ship, he ſoon after embarqued, leaving the fame of the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> ſpread abroad in all that Country. Being now embarqued, with his truſty Squire and Dwarf, he ſailed croſs thoſe Seas, and landed near the Port of <hi>Dublin,</hi> then called <hi>Ballicleagh,</hi> or the Town of <hi>Hurdles;</hi> it being, as moſt of all that Country is, built upon Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles laid upon a Bog. The whole Country of <hi>Ireland</hi> was at that time governed by one Monarch, who kept his chief reſidence at <hi>Dublin;</hi> but it was divided into four ſmall Kingdoms, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, called, <hi>Lemſter, Munſter, Ulſter,</hi> and <hi>Conaught:</hi> and over theſe there were ſeveral Kings, Earls, or Governors. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal King himſelf, whoſe name was <hi>Owen Roe Oneale,</hi> governed the Province of <hi>Lemſter</hi> particularly; the Governor of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who was his Brother, and Father to <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was named <hi>Mac Guire;</hi> the King, or Governor of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> was named <hi>Owen O Coneele;</hi> and the King, or Governor of <hi>Conaught,</hi> was named <hi>Owen Mac O Brian.</hi> Theſe were the ſeveral Governments, and theſe were the ſeveral Governors of this Kingdom, whoſe Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49948:161"/>was as antient as any in the World; for it was firſt formed into a Monarchy by King <hi>Gaelus,</hi> Son to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in the time of the Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was two thouſand years before the Incarnation of our bleſſed Lord and Savior; and it continues in the ſame way of Government to this day, never admitting of any but a Kingly Government.</p>

How he ſubmitted to the King, who told him of Wars in his Kingdom about <hi>Honna</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> who was beloved by the Prince of <hi>Conaught,</hi> but could not be ſuffered to Marry him by reaſon of the Gyant <hi>Fluſteron,</hi> who would compel her to be Married to him againſt her will. How the King with the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> went to the Wars, and after many bloody Battels, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of many Cities, the War was ended by the ſole valour of the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> who in a ſingle Combat ſlew the Giant <hi>Fluſteron.</hi>

                     <p>THe valiant Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> had no ſooner ſet footing on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhore, but he commanded his Horſe to be diſimbarqued, and he mounting his luſty Courſer, armed at all points, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on by his dear Squire <hi>Florello,</hi> and his truſty Dwarf, who were alſo mounted, he advanced towards the City of <hi>Dublin;</hi> but long had he not travelled, but he was met by four Knights, armed at all points, who commanded him to ſtand: he did ſo, and asked their buſineſs. They replied, <hi>He muſt go with them to the King their Maſter, and take ſuch an Oath as he would impoſe on him; or elſe leave his Horſe and Arms behind him.</hi> He hearing their terms, and not being uſed to be compelled to any thing ſo unreaſonable, anſwered, <hi>That he ſhould not, with his good will, take any Oath, much leſs leave his Arms.</hi> They told him, <hi>That this he muſt do, or elſe they would compel him:</hi> and thereupon one of them drew
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49948:161"/>near to ſeize on his Bridle; but he who was ſo forward, paid for his holdneſs; for he gave him ſuch a blow on the head, with the great end of his Lance, that he beat him breathleſs under his Horſes féet. His Companions ſéeing this, went all thrée to ſeize on him; but he turned his Horſe to avoid them, and thereby they paſſing on, he had the leiſurs to put his Lance in his Reſt, ready to receive them. They ſéeing him thus provided for them, all thrée ran againſt him; and although all thrée did hit him toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet they moved him no more then if he had béen a Tower: but they fared not ſo well, for he encountred one with his Lance, ſo that he was thrown over his Horſes crupper; and he ſeized on another in his arms, as he paſſed by, and drawing him out of his ſaddle, threw him on violently againſt the ground: and the third, who at that time eſcaped, was worſer treated; for at the next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, he threw him to the ground, and his Horſe upon him: and thus theſe four Knights being diſmounted, he paſſed on. But they in ſhort time recovering their Horſes, and mounting again, purſued him, but at ſome diſtance, ſo that he was near the City Walls before they overtook him; and then they rode up to the Guard there, crying out, <hi>Stop the Traytor who hath outraged us.</hi> The Guard, which conſiſted of ſix Knights, and above twenty Halberdiers, at this cry, put themſelves in a poſture to ſeize on him; and one, who was holder then the reſt, reaching out his arm to ſeize on his Bridle, for his preſumption, had it cut off near the ſhoulder; for the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> having already loſt his Lance, had now only his Sword, with which he did ſuch exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, that although they preſſed all forwards together, yet he made them ſtand further off; and thoſe that came within the reach of his Sword, were either killed or maimed: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49948:162"/>of Men, or the preſence of the King, made his way towards them, who now having their King in their company, laid luſtily about them, and he defended himſelf very couragiouſly; but however, being overpreſſed with the multitude that aſſaulted him on all ſides, he could not hinder his Horſe from being ſlain. He finding that his Horſe was killed, leaped from him, and again put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a poſture to withſtand his Enemies; and as his Horſe had ſerved him living, ſo now he was ſerviceable to him being dead; for he leaving him behind him, hindred his Aſſailants from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring him that way. The King all this while ſéeing the mighty valour of the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> was agaſt; but he had ſo great a power with him, that he was ſure to kill him, if he pleaſed; but being deſirous to have him alive, he cried out, <hi>Sir Knight, ceaſe this fruitleſs exerciſe of your valour, for in the end you muſt cerrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſlain, and ſurrender your ſelf to me; who, on the word of a King, promiſe, that no harm ſhall be done to you.</hi> Our Knight, hearing this, replied, <hi>I cannot believe any one in a Country where I have been ſo diſcourteouſly uſed; and therefore I ſhall ſtand upon my own defence; and I hope before I die, yet to ſend a great number of your diſcourteous and villa nous Subjects to the other World:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſtill ſo laid about him, that the dead he had killed lay on heaps about him. The King now ſéeing the death of ſo many of his Subjects before his eyes, and finding his mercy ſleighted, commanded a freſh party to fall on him, and hew him to pieces.</p>
                     <p>Iuſt as the King gave this command, the Squire <hi>Florello,</hi> who had béen all this while wéeping at the ſad condition of his Maſter, made way up to them, and throwing himſelf from his Horſe, fell on his knées before the King, deſiring him to ſtay the execution of his commands but for one minute, while he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49948:163"/>I ſhall be ready to obey your Majeſty in any of your Majeſtie; commands; and, I hope, with ſo good ſucceſs, that I ſhall make your Majeſty ſome part of amends for the loſs of thoſe Subjects who have (through their own raſhneſs) fallen by my hand: for had they acquainted me with the matter, as your Majeſty hath done, I ſhould have been as obedient to them, as now I am unto your Majeſty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King replied, <hi>That ſince what was paſſed could not be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he hoped he would not take any thing amiſs on his part, and then all ſhould be forgotten.</hi> And thereupon the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> taking his Oath, had his Sword deliv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now the King having the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> in his Court, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved forthwith to march with his Army, and try if he could compel theſe two angry Princes to agrée, and lay down their Arms; and therefore he ſoon after marched towards the famous City of <hi>Drummore,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> where then the Prince of that Province reſided. Being come near the place, he ſent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a Meſſenger to command him, in his Majeſties name, to disband his Army, and ſuffer all to depart; and promiſing that if he did ſo, he would command the Prince of <hi>Conaught</hi> to do ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and if he ſhould refuſe ſo to do, he would turn his whole force upon him, and compel him alſo to do the ſame. The Giant <hi>Fluſteron,</hi> who was then in the Prince of <hi>Ulſter</hi>'s Army, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing much confidence in his own ſtrength, returned anſwer, That if he intended to be obeyed there, he muſt firſt ſée the Prince of <hi>Conaught</hi> obey him in what he ſaid; or elſe they were reſolved to defend themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The King hearing of this proud anſwer, was reſolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céed againſt them: and the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> who had no a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the Giant <hi>Fluſteron,</hi> but rather inclined to the part of the Prince of <hi>Conaught,</hi> adviſed the King to aſſault the City, and take it by force; and thereupon, in ſhort time after, the aſſault was given, and that ſo couragiouſly, that notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance of the King of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> or the Giant <hi>Fluſteron,</hi> it was taken; and this furious Monſter, ſéeing that he could not hold it,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49948:164"/>was reſolved, rather then any elſe ſhould, to deſtroy it himſelf; wherefore he cauſed it to be ſet on fire in ſix ſeveral places: ſo that in few hours that proud and loſty City of <hi>Drummore</hi> was ruined, and ſtill remains a ſad ſpectacle to all Travellors.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Ulſter</hi> being forced out of this ruined City, fled, with the reſt of his Army, to another City of his, called <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and there fortified himſelf: and the Giant, <hi>Fluſteron,</hi> going to his own Territories, in the Mountains of <hi>Callingford,</hi> gathered together a-very ſtrong party, among which he brought many furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Monſters, and with this Recruit he relieved his intended Father in Law, the Prince of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> then in <hi>Dundalk;</hi> and now believing themſelves ſtrong enough, not only to oppoſe the King, but to méet him in the Field, they went out of the City, but to their loſs; for the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> who commanded the Van of the Kings Army, did ſet upon the Giant, and his Party, ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly, that notwithſtanding all the appoſition he could make, he forced them into the City. The King had many approved good Knights, and ſome Giants who lived on the Mountains of <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> in his own Province of <hi>Lemſter;</hi> but more eſpecially one who commanded the reſt, and who was indéed but little inferior to the Giant <hi>Fluſteron;</hi> and theſe two did often encounter each other, ſo that the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> had not yet had the opportunity of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the force of the Giant <hi>Fluſteron</hi> himſelf, but employing his courage in other places, ſoon made them fly before him. And now the Enemy was again incloſed within the City, and ſummons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again given him to obey the King's command, and he proudly refuſing, they were aſſaulted with the ſame ſucceſs as before; for after a violent reſiſtance it was taken; and now the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> ſéeing they ſo much delighted in ſtreing the former City of <hi>Drummore,</hi> cauſed the City of <hi>Dundalk</hi> to be alſo ſtred; and thus in few days were two brave Cities ruined. And now the King of <hi>Ulſter</hi> being ſtill obſtinate, and perſwaded by the Giant <hi>Fluſteron,</hi> or elſe indéed over-ruled by him, they fled from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till they came to the City of <hi>Dundrom,</hi> which being a famous Sea-port Town, was reckoned to be very ſecure, and there the Princeſs <hi>Honora,</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> reſided, ſhe who had béen the unhappy cauſe of all theſe Wars, which ſhe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of, and that ſhe might be the cauſe of her Father's ruine,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49948:164"/>conſidered alſo which way to prevent it; and therefore ſent to her Lover, <hi>Owen Mac O Brian,</hi> Prince of <hi>Conaught,</hi> to deſire him to lay down his Arms, and leave her to the diſpoſal of her Father; for if he obſtinately perſiſted, ſhe would never have him, although frée to diſpoſe of her ſelf; and ſéeing his firſt taking up of Arms againſt her Father had béen for her ſake, to hinder her marriage with <hi>Fluſteron,</hi> ſo ſhe deſired him, that for her ſake, he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo lay down his Arms; and then ſhe queſtioned not but her Father would be induced to do ſo too, and a Peace would follow; and ſhe hoped then ſo to order affairs, as that ſhe might content him and her ſelf. This Prince who was ſtill in Arms in his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and only waited the motions of the two other Armies, now hearing the deſires of his Princeſs, knew not what to reſolve on; but being willing to oblige her in all he could, and not thinking it convenient to lay down Arms till the War was ended, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on a third courſe, which was, to take paſt with her Father, relieve and aſſiſt him againſt the King, and thereby, as he hoped, oblige him to beſtow his Daughter on him; and therefore away he marcheth with all his Army towards the City of <hi>Dundrom,</hi> where the King and the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> had beſieged the King of <hi>Ulſter.</hi> The news of his approach ſurprized the King; neither did the Prince of <hi>Ulſter</hi> know what he intended: but he ſoon ſent a Letter to acquaint him, that although he had appeared his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my when alone in the Field, yet now, that he ſaw him likely to be oppreſſed by the King, and his numerous and victorious For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, be would joyn intereſts with him, till he had frée<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Giant <hi>Fluſteton</hi> hearing of this meſſage, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it might turn to his diſadvantage, would not permit the Prince of <hi>Ulſter</hi> to return him any anſwer; but told him, that he would take ſuch order, that the King of <hi>Lemſter</hi> ſhould ſoon be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreed to withdraw his Forces: and the way he propounded was this; that they, being we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49948:165"/>might eſcape by ſea; but he did not expect any ſuch matters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prince of <hi>Conaught</hi> would hinder the King from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding ſo forwards; and he leaving a ſufficient Party to ſecure the Princeſs, left the City of <hi>Dundrom,</hi> and went to his own Country, and there raiſing another great Party, he roved up and down, and at length entring the Province of <hi>Lemſter,</hi> in the King's abſence, did much miſchief, burning and deſtroying all places where he came, thinking by this means to force the King to raiſe his ſiege, and return home to guard his own Country. But the King not knowing of this miſchief, but ſéeing the Forces of the Prince of <hi>Conaught,</hi> ſent to know, why he came thither armed? commanding him to depart, and disband his Forces. He anſwered, that he could not indéed deny but that he was his Sovereign, and therefore ought to be obeyed; but that withal, what he did was for ſelf-preſervation, and to ſerve a Miſtreſs whom he eſtéemed above all; for he believed that if he ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him abſolutely to conquer his Neighbor the Prince of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> and thereby his Miſtreſs would alſo be deſtroyed, it would not be long before he ſerved him in the ſame manner, and ſo become ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, not permitting them their antient Principallity, to which they had as much right as he to his abſolute Sovereignty; and therefore the cauſe why he could not obey him at preſent, was, becauſe he was reſolved not to ſit ſtill, and firſt ſée his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors Principallity taken from him, and then his own. This was the anſwer he ſent; whereupon the King ſent away to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mac Guire,</hi> Prince of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and Father to <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to raiſe what Forces he could, and come to his aſſiſtance, reſolving to compel theſe two Princes to obey him. The Prince of <hi>Munſter</hi> knowing of the War, and doubting of the events there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, had already raiſed an Army to be in readineſs, and therefore was quickly on his way to his Brother before <hi>Dundrom:</hi> but in the mean time the Giant <hi>Fluſteron</hi> had committed many villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; for he had ſurprized the antient City of <hi>Tredagh</hi> in <hi>Lemſter,</hi> and deſtroying the Inhabitants, very much ruined the City it ſelf; and now hearing that the Prince of <hi>Munſter</hi> was ingaged againſt his Party, he marches into his Country, and ſpoils ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places there, but more particularly the Town of <hi>Rabennee,</hi> which he ſet on fire: and now all the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> was
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49948:165"/>ingaged in a War which was very bloody, and all occaſioned by the wilfulneſs of this Monſter <hi>Fluſteron,</hi> who now, ſuppoſing it neceſſary, makes all haſte poſſible to the City of <hi>Dundrom,</hi> and getting into it, gives an account of his villainies. By the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which he brought, the City was ſo well relieved, that it was reſolved they would no longer be incloſed within the walls, but go out and face, and fight their Enemies; knowing that if the Prince of <hi>Conaught</hi> did them no good, he would not harm them by aſſiſting their Enemies; wherefore he, making all the Forces he could, marched out of the City, and being fleſhed and encouraged by the ſucceſs he had abroad, hoped to have the ſame here in the Field: and now, being reſolved to fight, he queſtioned not but he ſhould conquer; and therefore was ſo bold, as to ſend to the King to defie him, and to appoint a pitcht Battle thrée days after, or ſooner, if he would. The King, hearing of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, called his Councel, to adviſe what was to be done. And there the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> adviſed the King, to agrée to the Battle to be fought thrée days after; and in the mean time to have a Truce, ſo that any ſingle Perſons might be frée to viſit their Enemies Camp, or City. All this was agréed on by all Parties: and the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> having leave of the King, and power to treat as he thought fit, was reſolved to treat with all Parties, and ſée if by his prudent management he might put an end to this War without fighting: Whereupon, the chief occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this War being about the Marriage of the Princeſs <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora,</hi> he firſt went to her; and there he, examining her to every thing, found that ſhe had an abſolute antipathy againſt, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the Giant <hi>Fluſteron,</hi> her intended Husband; and that rather then have him, ſhe would deſtroy her ſelf: and that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ſhe had as great a love for the Prince of <hi>Conaught, Owen Mac O Brian,</hi> whom ſhe would with all her heart be married to. The Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> having heard her mind, told her, that he would endeavor that ſhe ſhould have her deſire; and therefore he went next to her Father, <hi>Owen O Coneele,</hi> Prince of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> of whom he likewiſe deſired to know, <hi>If he had any inclination to Peace?</hi> The old Man replied, <hi>he deſired it above all things, being weary of the War long time ſince; and that he would have left it off, if the Giant <hi>Fluſteron</hi> would have permitted him.</hi> The Knight of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49948:166"/>
                        <hi>Cupid</hi> hearing this, told him, <hi>The occaſion of the War</hi> (as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>was, becauſe he would compel his Daughter to marry with <hi>Fluſteron</hi> againſt her own mind. Truly</hi> (replied the old Prince) <hi>I had no inclination that ſhe ſhould be married to <hi>Owen Mac O Brian,</hi> Prince of <hi>Conaught,</hi> becauſe we have been ancient Enemies, and therefore was willing the other, my Friend and Subject, ſhould have her; and that hath occaſioned this unhappy War: but I now wiſh that it were otherwiſe, and did not care if ſhe were married to the Prince of <hi>Conaught,</hi> or left to whom ſhe her ſelf ſhould pleaſe, ſo I knew how to rid my ſelf of <hi>Fluſteron,</hi> who is grown now too potent for me, and over-rules all my Councels. As for that,</hi> (replied the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi>) <hi>if you pleaſe to give your Daughter free leave to marry, I queſtion not but I ſhall end the War without much more blood-ſhed, and that you ſhall be well enough rid of <hi>Fluſteron.</hi> If it may be ſo, I ſhould be content,</hi> replied the old Prince, and ſo they parted. And now the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> thought it expedient to go to the Giant <hi>Fluſteron;</hi> where when he came, he told him that he had béen the whole cauſe of the War; and that it would be well done of him to endeavor an end of it, by permitting the Lady <hi>Honora</hi> to chooſe whom ſhe would for a Husband. <hi>Why, whom ſhould ſhe chooſe but</hi> me, (replied the Giant, fiercely) <hi>who have beſt deſerved her? It may be ſo ſhe will,</hi> (replied the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi>) <hi>and that it will be the beſt way to give her her own freedom. I ſhall not truſt the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Baggage,</hi> (ſaid the Giant) <hi>but I will have her alive or dead; and as I have, ſo I will always hazard my life to gain her. I would that young Princely Puppet of <hi>Conaught</hi> would either fight with me for her, or produce any body elſe that would do it, and then it ſhould be ſoon ſeen who beſt deſerves her. I muſt confeſs</hi> (ſaid the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi>) <hi>that for force and valour you may exceed him, but there are other qualities that a Lady expects above that. What ſhould any Ladies expect,</hi> (replied the Giant) <hi>but to marry where their Parents think fit, and to obey thoſe Husbands who can gain moſt from others, and thereby enlarge their own Dominions? This is your opinion,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Knight of <hi>Cupid; but I ſtill adviſe you to let the Lady have her own chooſing. Yes, if I were ſure ſhe will chooſe me,</hi> replied he; <hi>or elſe, if she will renounce all her intereſt to her Father's Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and he give me preſent poſſeſſion of it. That were unreaſonable,</hi> replied the Knight, <hi>I rather believe that the Prince of <hi>Conaught</hi> will
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49948:166"/>produce a Champion to fight in hers and his own behalf. I ſhould be glad to ſee him,</hi> (replied the Giant) <hi>and that ſhall be the end of the War. I will go ask him,</hi> replied the Knight, and ſo departed. And now, at laſt, going to the Prince of <hi>Conaught,</hi> he told him, <hi>That he had been much too blame to ingage a Kingdom in a War, out of pretence of aſſiſting of a Lady. Then I perceive, Sir,</hi> replied the Prince, <hi>you have never been in love; for if you had, you would not value ten Kingdoms to a Ladies enjoyment. Well, but how do you think to gain her?</hi> replied the Knight; <hi>for I know that you muſt never have her, unleſs the Giant <hi>Fluſteron</hi> be firſt dead, and that, I think, is ſomewhat difficult to be done. Truly,</hi> replied the Prince, <hi>rather then loſe her, I would venture my own Perſon againſt that Monſter. But do you imagine,</hi> ſaid the Knight, <hi>that you ſhould vanquiſh him? Truly, I much doubt it,</hi> replied the Prince; <hi>but I then could but die, and then all my ſorrow would at once be at an end.</hi> The Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> hearing him thus reſolute, and pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Parties, and being deſirous to make an end of this War, for the doing whereof there was but one way, told the Prince, that he would undertake the Combat on his behalf; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired him to agrée to what he ſhould direct, and then he queſtioned not but he ſhould ſuddainly put an end to the War, to his own content. The Prince knowing well enough the great valor of the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> as having heard of his fight at his firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in that Kingdom, and withal having ſéen other teſtimonies of his valour during the War, and believing that if he undertook the Combat, he ſhould be ſucceſsful, he therefore kindly thanked him for his generous offer, telling him, <hi>That if he would, on his behalf, enter the Combat againſt his Enemy, and conquer him, as he did not queſtion, he would freely give him his Principality, only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himſelf with the in joyment of the fair Princeſs <hi>Honora.</hi>
                        </hi> The Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> hearing the generous offer of the Prince, replied, <hi>That he deſired no other requital, but the honour of having done him that particular ſervice, and, as he hoped, a general good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This Letter was conveyed to the Giant <hi>Fluſteron,</hi> who was ſo joyful of the news, that he told the Meſſenger, that his Pledges ſhould return with him; and thereupon he went immediately to the Prince of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> and told him, that the War would now in few days be ended, ſhewing him the Letter, and telling him, that he was reſolved on the Combat, and therefore deſired him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound his Pledges for the performance of the Articles. The old Prince gladly accepted of the terms, and ſoon ſent the Pledges, and then the Prince of <hi>Conaught</hi> ſent his; and every one of the Princes, being acquainted with the terms of the Combat, ſent Pledges to each other.</p>
                     <p>Theſe nows were not carried ſo privately, but that the Squire <hi>Florello</hi> heard thereof, and underſtood that his Lord, the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> was to perform the Combat with this monſtrous Giant; wherefore, as being ſufficiently concerned in the great hazard he
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49948:167"/>would undergo, he uſed all the Arguments he could to diſſwade him therefrom: But ſo great was the Knights love of Glory, that I believe he would have procéeded, although the Squire had truly diſcovered himſelf to be the Princeſs <hi>Florida;</hi> for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the many tears which were ſhed to diſſwade him, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in his reſolution. And now all the Princes were joyful that there was ſo great a probability of ending the Wars. But when the Giant <hi>Fluſteron</hi> heard who was to be his oppoſer, and fight againſt him, he ſo much diſdained him, that he now aſcertained himſelf of the Victory.</p>
                     <p>The day and hour appointed for the Combat being come, both the Combatants met in a place in the view of all the Armies, and being both ready fitted, they ran at each other with ſuch violence, that both their Lances flew into hundreds of pieces in the Air, and they encountring with their Bodies, made one another ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the great ſtrength that was in them. But they whéeling about, drew their ſharp cutting Swords, and laid on moſt coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly. The Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> who was no Novice in this art of fighting, gave the Giant ſo mighty a blow on the Shield that he cut it in two, and deſcending, wounded the Giant in the thigh; but he ſoon paid him for that blow, by returning him another, and wounding him in the ſhoulder. And now our Knight was in ſhort time at the ſame loſs here, by the ſame defect of his Sword, which flew in pieces, as he had béen at <hi>Windſor;</hi> and the Giant ſtruck him ſo furiouſly, that his alſo brake near the hilt; wherefore they ſéeing the diſadvantage they both had, they reſolved on a ſecond way of fighting, which was with cloſing, and trying the ſtrength of each others arms, the Giant ſuppoſing he ſhould be too hard for his Enemy in that manner of fighting; but the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> not only cleared himſelf from his Enemy, but drawing a Poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard ſtabbed him in ſeveral places.

                     <p>THe Giant being thus ſlain, there was no Perſon diſſatisfied, only ſome few of his particular Friends; who although they were troubled at his loſs, yet at a time of ſo general joy, they put on as pleaſant countenances as the reſt. The Princeſs <hi>Honora,</hi> in few days, by the importunity of the Prince of <hi>Conaught,</hi> and with the conſent of the Prince her Father, agreed to be married to him. And now all the ſeveral Armies were disbanded; and all who had not a deſign to mirth and jollity, at the Wedding which was ſuddainly to be ſolemnized, went to their particular habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And the Prince of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who had a very great love to the Prince of <hi>Conaughr,</hi> deſired all Parties to go to his Court at the City of <hi>Wexford,</hi> deſiring that the Wedding might be kept there; he promiſing to be at the whole expence of it, as not having had any joy, or recreation, at his Court, ſince the news of the ſuppoſed loſs of his Son <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Knight of the <hi>Keys;</hi> and new all Parties, at this invitation, went thither, and nothing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49948:168"/>was thought on but Triumphs, and Tournaments, to be held for ſome days, when this Wedding ſhould be ſolemnized.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> having happily accompliſhed the affairs of others, now thought of his own; and being in diſcourſe with his beloved Squire <hi>Florello,</hi> who had intreated him to diſpatch, and return to his Lady <hi>Florida,</hi> had promiſed ſo ſoon as this Wedding was over to return to her, and ceaſe his fruitleſs ſearch after the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena;</hi> for he had inquired of the Prince of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> but could hear no news of her. But he had not as yet unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Prince, who ſuppoſed his Son <hi>Peter</hi> to be dead, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him with the news of his life, and good health; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was reſolved now, at the time of this general joy, to tell him the whole ſtory, and thereby cauſe a particular joy to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that intended it only for the Fathers ſake; and knowing that the Mother of the Knight would be as much joyed as the Father, he therefore one day told the Prince, that he had ſome news to tell him, which he believed would pleaſe him; but withal, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that his Wife might be preſent at the relation. The Prince, at this, preſently taking him by the hand, led him directly to the place where his Lady was, telling her, that this fortunate Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> had ſomewhat to acquaint them withal, which, he que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned not, would be pleaſing to them, ſince his coming into that Country had béen ſo pleaſant to all in general. <hi>Ah!</hi> replied the Princeſs with a ſigh, <hi>I never expect any good news again, ſince I had that unpleaſant ſight of the red Purſe with the Jewels, which I gave to my unfortunate Son <hi>Peter.</hi> Madam,</hi> replied the Knight of <hi>Cupid, before I ſhall relate to you what I intended, I deſire of you to tell me what you mean by that red Purſe with Jewels, for I know ſomewhat of that Adventure. I ſhall ſoon ſatisfie you in that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſtory,</hi> replied ſhe, and ſo began. <hi>I had</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>a Son, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Peter,</hi> who was a very hopeful Perſon, and being Knighted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, as other young men do, to travel abroad in the world to ſeek Adventures; his Father and I, both unwillingly permitted him; and at his departure I gave him a red Purſe, and in it three Jewels, giving him a charge to be careful of them: but ſo it is, that he in ſome unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Sea-voyage loſt them, and, I believe, his life; for the very ſame Purſe and Jewels came ſince to my hands in the belly of a Sturgeon; and from thence I conclude, that he at that time periſhed, for I could
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49948:169"/>never hear any news of him ſince his departure.</hi> And at this ſhe concluded her diſcourſe, with a great ſigh, followed by ſome tears. The Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> much wondered at the ſtrange adventure of the Purſe; but however he ſoon gueſſed how formerly it had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and ſoon gave them a particular account of their Son <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> The old Prince, and Princeſs, hearing this joyful news, were ſo glad, that ſhe, good Lady, fell into a ſwoon for joy; but, by the aſſiſtance of her Damſels, ſoon recovered, and would have embraced and kiſſed the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> for his good news: but he deſired her to be patient, and he would relate the whole of her Sons Adventures to her; and thereupon he acquainted them of his arrival in <hi>Sardinia;</hi> his love to the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena;</hi> her leaving her Parents to travel with him; their ſhipwrack on the Iſle of <hi>Sicilia;</hi> the loſs of the Purſe and Iewels, which occaſioned the loſs of the Princeſs; and his great pains in ſearching for her; in which ſearch, ſaid the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> I am now engaged.</p>
                     <p>And thus did the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> finiſh his diſcourſe, not only to the great joy and ſatisfaction of the Parents of the worthy Knight <hi>Peter,</hi> but alſo all the Family, all the City, all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, nay, all the Kingdom rejoycing thereat: and now was the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> much more honoured by all then he had béen; more eſpecially by the Prince of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who entertained him in his own Palace, and was very deſirous to know his Quality, which our Knight as yet concealed, telling him however, that he ſhould know it before he parted.</p>
                     <p>And now the Court being filled with this good news, it was not long before it came to the ears of <hi>Magdalena,</hi> who was much joyed thereat, and thought to diſcover her ſelf; but ſhe was prevented by the Squire <hi>Florello,</hi> who, ſéeing <hi>Magdalena,</hi> knew her, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted to her preſence, thus began: <hi>I am very much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken if I have not formerly been very well acquainted with you; and that, if you look earneſtly on me, as I have done on you, you may know me through the diſguiſe I am now in, as well as I do you though diſguiſed, as I am ſure; you are <hi>Magdalena.</hi>
                        </hi> Knowing that the Speaker was in the right, as to her diſguiſe, ſhe looked earneſtly; but all that ſhe could anſwer, was, <hi>That indeed the features of the face were known to her, but in that habit ſhe could diſcover no further; but,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>if you do know me, as you ſay, I pray tell me of that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49948:169"/>knowledge, and then I ſhall the better judge who you are alſo. I know,</hi> replied <hi>Florida, that you are the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena</hi> of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia;</hi> and if you look well on me, you may alſo know me to be your Couſin <hi>Florida,</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Sicilia.</hi>
                        </hi> At theſe words they joyned arms and bodies, and embraced one another; and having ſpent ſome time in that pleaſing exerciſe, the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena</hi> ſaid, <hi>Dear Couſin, ſince you know me, you alſo know the reaſon of my preſent diſguiſe; wherefore, I pray, tell me the reaſon of yours. The very ſame reaſon,</hi> replied <hi>Florida; Love is the occaſion: and now you are found, my Adventures are at an end.</hi> Whereupon ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her with all her particular Adventures; as, her Love to the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> and her ſtrange attending him thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed. And now theſe two Ladies became pleaſant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted what was neceſſary to be done to compleat their happineſs; and therefore it was concluded, that the Princeſs <hi>Florida</hi> ſhould, with the firſt conveniency, diſcover all to the Knight of <hi>Cupid;</hi> and after that ſeveral diſcourſes had paſſed betwéen them, how they ſhould manage their affairs, they ſeparated. <hi>Florida</hi> ſoon found out the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> who could not well endure her out of his company; and they coming into a convenient place, ſhe thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. <hi>My Lord, I hope you intend in few days to leave this place, and return to my Lady. Yes,</hi> replied he; <hi>but I would gladly find the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena,</hi> and then I would make all poſſible haſte to ſee my Lady. And will you,</hi> replied ſhe, <hi>be married to her ſo ſoon as you ſee her? Aſſure your ſelf,</hi> replied the Knight, <hi>that the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I ſhall ſee her, I will be married to her, if ſhe deſires it; and I will never have any other deſires but what ſhall pleaſe her. Well then,</hi> replied <hi>Florida, I shall tell you ſome news that will pleaſe you; and thus it is, I have heard of the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena,</hi> and to morrow I will acquaint you further of her.</hi> The Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> hearing this, deſired preſently to be further ſatisfied; but <hi>Florello</hi> asked leave till the next morning to perform his promiſe: and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, they both aroſe; and <hi>Florello,</hi> who muſt now loſe that name, left the Palace, and went to the Monaſtery; where, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to appointment, a very fair Gown, and other neceſſaries, according to the quality of a Princeſs, was provided, and <hi>Florida</hi> dreſſed therein: by ſuch time as this was done, the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> was come, and admitted to the preſence of the Principal;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49948:170"/>where he thus began: <hi>Madam,</hi> I was informed that you could give me ſome account of a ſtrayed Princeſs, named <hi>Magdalena.</hi> Truly, replied ſhe, I know ſomewhat of her: but there is a Lady in this place, that can give you certain intelligence of her. I beg the favor then, ſaid the Knight, to ſée and ſpeak with this Lady. That you may, ſaid <hi>Magdalena;</hi> and thereupon coming into the Room where the Lady was dreſſed, took her by the hand, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veyled, led her out. She came near the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> and ſtood ſome time veyled; and he earneſtly expecting to ſée and ſpeak to her: but at length ſhe turned up her veyl, and diſcovered her ſelf to be the true Princeſs <hi>Florida.</hi> Our Knight now looking earneſtly on her, ſtarted back, as amazed, and cryed out, What do mine eyes behold! I come to inquire after anothers Lady, and find my own, or one ſo like her, that they may be well of near kin to one another. Speak, Madam, I beſéech you, ſaid he; and ſatisfie my troubled ſpirit. You are not at all miſtaken, replied the Princeſs; and ſéeing you made ſuch tarriance, I have left my Country to find you. He hearing her ſpeak, and that in her perfect tone, ran and ſaluted her; and inquired how ſhe got thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and ſo many queſtions he asked together, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to anſwer him. He told her, that a Squire whom ſhe ſent to ſerve him, had told him, that at that place he ſhould hear of the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena;</hi> but, ſaid he, though I ſhould have béen very joyful to have found that Lady, yet I am much more glad to ſée you. That Squire of yours, replied <hi>Florida,</hi> can be as good as his word. Then I will ſoon find him, replied the Knight. But without my help you cannot, anſwered <hi>Florida;</hi> and with my help you may find not only him, but the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena</hi> alſo. Oh, dear Madam, ſaid the Knight, make me ſo happy as to unfold theſe riddles. Yea, replied ſhe; but withal, you will firſt, before this holy Woman here, ſaid ſhe, promiſe to perform your promiſe of marriage to me. With all my heart, replied the Knight; and I am very joyful that you propound that which will make up all my happineſs: and thereupon he promiſed to be married to her the next day, or ſo ſoon as ſhe pleaſed. He having finiſhed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſhe ſaid, And now I will be as good as my word; and taking the Principal by the hand, ſhe preſented her unto him, ſaying, Here, behold the end of your travels, for this is the Princeſs <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalena.</hi>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:49948:170"/>The Knight was now as much aſtoniſhed at the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena,</hi> as he had béen at her own diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and kiſſing her hand, told her, that he now accounted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf happy indéed; in that he had not only recovered his own La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but performed his promiſe to his Friend <hi>Peter:</hi> But, ſaid he, I am beholden to my Squire <hi>Florello</hi> for all this happineſs; and therefore although I am much delighted with your companies, yet I ſhall be glad to have his, who only can reſolve me of all things. I tell you, replied <hi>Florida,</hi> that you cannot without me ſpeak with him. You tell me wonders, replied the Knight; and I ſhall after this rate believe, that all I have ſéen this day is but a dream, and that you are but my imaginary Lady. Nay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe, if this ſurprizes you, I am ſure that what I ſhall next tell you will do much more. I beſeech you, Madam, ſaid he, let me hear it, that all my wonders may he over wonders, I may well call them, and this the day of wanders to me. You deſire, replied ſhe, to ſée <hi>Florello,</hi> your Squire; look on me, do you ſée me? Yes, ſaid he. And do you know me? Yes, ſaid he, for my Princeſs <hi>Florida.</hi> And do you know <hi>Florello</hi> when you ſée him? ſaid ſhe. I think I do, ſaid he; it is not long ſince I ſaw him. That is true, replied ſhe; but withal I tell you, you do not know him, nor never ſhall again. Why? was he a Spirit? replied the Knight; if he were, he was a bleſſed one to me. No, ſaid ſhe, no more a ſpirit then I am; and leſt you ſhould ſuppoſe me to be one, I give you my hand to féel. I am ſure, ſaid he, that this is fleſh and blood. And ſo was <hi>Florello,</hi> ſaid ſhe? but now no more <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rello,</hi> but <hi>Florida:</hi> I was he. Now! Madam, ſaid the Knight, this cannot be poſſible; I am amazed indéed, and confounded, and ſhall diſtruſt the reſt, and all to be a dream, or elſe conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I will aſſure you, Sir, ſaid <hi>Magdalena,</hi> all that hath béen hitherto told you, is true; and to convince you of the truth of this laſt particular, which you ſo much doubt, behold the habit this Lady wore this morning when ſhe came in hither; and therewith produced the clothes of <hi>Florello.</hi> Nay, then, ſaid the Knight, I do believe all the reſt: and then running to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Florida,</hi> and ſtrictly embracing her, he cryed out, Ah my dear Princeſs, my beloved <hi>Florello,</hi> what ſhall I call you that have ſo often deceived me when I lay in bed with you, and wiſhed for you
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49948:171"/>who was ſo near me, and you unkind refuſed to acquaint me. Well, replied the Princeſs bluſhing, let all that be forgotten; and now, I hope, you will conclude all true, and are confirmed in my love to you. A dull Fool I was, replied the Knight, that I could not all this while make this pleaſant diſcovery: I now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the tenderneſs you had for me when I fought with the Giant at <hi>Windſor;</hi> the pity you had for me, when by my raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I had like to have thrown away my life at my firſt arrival in this Kingdom; and the arguments you uſed to diſſwade me from fighting with the late Giant <hi>Fluſteron</hi> here. Any of theſe conſiderations had béen enough to have opened mine eyes, and diſcovered you: but I by that now know your great love, which, Madam, ſaid he, I ſhall endeavor through the whole courſe of my life to retaliate, in being wholly at your diſpoſe; and thereupon he again kiſſed and embraced her.</p>
                     <p>And now ſome time having béen ſpent in this diſcovery, they all thrée ſate down to conſult what was neceſſary to be done: and after various propoſitions, it was concluded, that the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena</hi> ſhould diſcover her ſelf to the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Munſter,</hi> to the end their Son <hi>Peter</hi> hearing of it, might make the more haſte home. And therefore the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> went that day to the Prince, and told him, that he had more good news to acquaint him withal; and his Lady bellig in company, he told them, that as he had brought them news of their Son, ſo he could quickly bring him home, by putting that Lady, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Magdalena,</hi> whom he was in ſearch of, into their cuſtody. They both told him, that if he could do that, it would be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible way, and therefore he told them the whole ſtory; that the Principal of Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s Monaſtery, was the Princeſs <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena;</hi> and that he was aſſured of this by a Lady, and Princeſs of his, named <hi>Florida,</hi> who was lately come into her Company. So joyed were the old Prince and Princeſs of this news, that they went preſently to the Monaſtery; and after many diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with the fair <hi>Magdalena,</hi> they brought her, and the Princeſs <hi>Florida,</hi> to Court: and the ſame of this Adventure quickly can through all the Court and City, ſo that the Princeſs <hi>Honora</hi> ſoon came to viſit them; and ſo did all the Princes and Princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49948:171"/>the great Beauty of theſe two excellent Princeſſes, <hi>Magdalena,</hi> and <hi>Florida.</hi> And the Story of the Adventures of theſe two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies was ſo rare and excellent, that it is remembred, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated throughout <hi>Ireland</hi> to this day.</p>
                     <p>And now nothing but Triumphs were thought of againſt the Wedding of the Prince of <hi>Conaught,</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Honora:</hi> and the Knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> intended alſo on that day to be ſolemnly married to the Princeſs <hi>Florida.</hi> Nothing was wanting to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the happineſs of all this Court, but the preſence of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Knight <hi>Peter,</hi> whom we having leſt in the Army, before the City of <hi>Pharez,</hi> we will go thither to him.</p>
                     <p>Many aſſaults did the Prince of <hi>Mumidia</hi> give to the City of <hi>Pharez</hi> with different fortune, for he was not always Conqueror.
